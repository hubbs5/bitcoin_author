While responding to Ian Grigg's comment to my previous blog entry on kula, I came up with what is the most rigorous explanation for the two-collectible cycle that I've seen.  The explanation neatly incorporates two patterns I've talked about in the past, namely (1) the literal circulation of collectibles in specific cycles to minimize non-coincidence transaction costs in a bilateral monopoly economy, and (2) trust minimization in institution design.
A number of my friends have gotten wrapped up in a movement dubbed "The Singularity."   We now have a "Singularity Institute", a NASA-sponsored "Singularity University", and so on as leading futurist organizations.  I tend to let my disagreements on these kinds of esoteric futurist visions slide, but I've been thinking about my agreements and disagreements with this movement for long enough that I shall now share them.One of the basic ideas behind this movement, that computers can help make themselves smarter, and that growth that for a time looks exponential, or even super-exponential in some dimensions and may end up much faster than today may result, is by no means off the wall.  Indeed computers have been helping improve future versions of themselves at least since the first compiler and circuit design software was invented.  But "the Singularity" itself is an incoherent and, as the capitalization suggests, basically a religious idea.   As well as a nifty concept for marketing AI research to investors who like very high risk and reward bets.The "for a time" bit is crucial.  There is as Feynman said "plenty of room at the bottom" but it is by no means infinite given actually demonstrated physics.   That means all growth curves that look exponential or more in the short run turn over and become S-curves or similar in the long run, unless we discover physics that we do not now know, as information and data processing under physics as we know it are limited by the number of particles we have access to, and that in turn can only increase in the long run by at most a cubic polynomial (and probably much less than that, since space is mostly empty).Rodney Brooks thus calls the Singularity "a period" rather than a single point in time, but if so then why call it a singularity?As for "the Singularity" as a point past which we cannot predict, the stock market is by this definition an ongoing, rolling singularity, as are most aspects of the weather, and many quantum events, and many other aspects of our world and society.   And futurists are notoriously bad at predicting the future anyway, so just what is supposed to be novel about an unpredictable future?The Singularitarian notion of an all-encompassing or "general" intelligence flies in the face of how our modern economy, with its extreme specialization, works.  We have been implementing human intelligence in computers little bits and pieces at a time, and this has been going on for centuries.   First arithmetic (first with mechanical calculators), then bitwise Boolean logic (from the early parts of the 20th century with vacuum tubes), then accounting formulae and linear algebra (big mainframes of the 1950s and 60s), typesetting (Xerox PARC, Apple, Adobe, etc.), etc. etc. have each gone through their own periods of exponential and even super-exponential growth.  But it's these particular operations, not intelligence in general, that exhibits such growth.At the start of the 20th century, doing arithmetic in one's head was one of the main signs of intelligence.  Today machines do quadrillions of additions and subtractions for each one done in a human brain, and this rarely bothers or even occurs to us.   And the same extreme division of labor that gives us modern technology also means that AI has and will take the form of these hyper-idiot, hyper-savant, and hyper-specialized machine capabilities.  Even if there was such a thing as a "general intelligence" the specialized machines would soundly beat it in the marketplace.  It would be very far from a close contest.Another way to look at the limits of this hypothetical general AI is to look at the limits of machine learning.  I've worked extensively with evolutionary algorithms and other machine learning techniques.  These are very promising but are also extremely limited without accurate and complete simulations of an environment in which to learn.  So for example in evolutionary techniques the "fitness function" involves, critically, a simulation of electric circuits (if evolving electric circuits), of some mechanical physics (if evolving simple mechanical devices or discovering mechanical laws), and so on.These techniques only can learn things about the real world to the extent such simulations accurately simulate the real world, but except for extremely simple situations (e.g. rediscovering the formulae for Kepler's laws based on orbital data, which a modern computer with the appropriate learning algorithm can now do in seconds) the simulations are usually very woefully incomplete, rendering the results usually useless.   For example John Koza after about 20 years of working on genetic programming has discovered about that many useful inventions with it, largely involving easily simulable aspects of electronic circults.  And "meta GP", genetic programming that is supposed to evolve its own GP-implementing code, is useless because we can't simulate future runs of GP without actually running them.   So these evolutionary techniques, and other machine learning techniques, are often interesting and useful, but the severely limited ability of computers to simulate most real-world phenomena means that no runaway is in store, just potentially much more incremental improvements which will be much greater in simulable arenas and much smaller in others, and will slowly improve as the accuracy and completeness of our simulations slowly improves.The other problem with tapping into computer intelligence -- and there is indeed after a century of computers quite a bit of very useful but very alien intelligence there to tap into -- is the problem of getting information from human minds to computers and vice versa.  Despite all the sensory inputs we can attach to computers these days, and vast stores of human knowledge like Wikipedia that one can feed to them, almost all such data is to a computer nearly meaningless.  Think Helen Keller but with most of her sense of touch removed on top of all her other tragedies.   Similarly humans have an extremely tough time deciphering the output of most software unless it is extremely massaged.  We humans have huge informational bottlenecks between each other, but these hardly compare to the bottlenecks between ourselves and the hyperidiot/hypersavant aliens in our midst, our computers.  As a result he vast majority of programmer time is spent working on user interfaces and munging data rather than on the internal workings of programs.Nor does the human mind, as flexible as it is, exhibit much in the way of some universal general intelligence.  Many machines and many other creatures are capable of sensory, information-processing, and output feats that the human mind is quite incapable of.  So even if we in some sense had a full understanding of the human mind (and it is information theoretically impossible for one human mind to fully understand even one other human mind), or could somehow faithfully "upload" a human mind to a computer (another entirely conjectural operation, which may require infeasible simulations of chemistry), we would still not have "general" intelligence, again if such a thing even exists.That's not to say that many of the wide variety of techniques that go under the rubric "AI" are not or will not be highly useful, and may even lead to accelerated economic growth as computers help make themselves smarter.  But these will turn into S-curves as they approach physical limits and the idea that this growth or these many and varied intelligences are in any nontrivial way "singular" is very wrong.
In my previous entry I mentioned the software patents paper I wrote a few months ago, and I have now put it online.  In this paper I describe how software came to be patentable in the United States despite the Supreme Court's holdings that "mathematical algorithms" are unpatentable.  I now reiterate the recommendation I made in the paper: the Supreme Court should reverse the Federal Circuit's holding in Metabolite based on the subject matter limitation in 35 U.S.C. 101.  It should analyze subject matter patentability based on the Neilson test as applied in Parker v. Flook and clarified in the paper.
Perhaps I should take up Twitter, but I already have this blog, and even my short takes tend to go a bit over 140 characters. So here goes: * The most important professions in the modern world may be the most reviled: advertiser, salesperson, lawyer, and financial trader. What these professions have in common is extending useful social interactions far beyond the tribe-sized groups we were evolved to inhabit (most often characterized by the Dunbar number). This commonly involves activities that fly in the face of our tribal moral instincts.* On a related note, much mistaken thinking about society could be eliminated by the most straightforward application of the pigeonhole principle: you can't fit more pigeons into your pigeon coop than you have holes to put them in. Even if you were telepathic, you could not learn all of what is going on in everybody's head because there is no room to fit all that information in yours. If I could completely scan 1,000 brains and had some machine to copy the contents of those into mine, I could only learn at most about a thousandth of the information stored in those brains, and then only at the cost of forgetting all else I had known. That's a theoretical optimum; any such real-world transfer process, such as reading and writing an e-mail or a book, or tutoring, or using or influencing a market price, will pick up only a small fraction of even the theoretically acquirable knowledge or preferences in the mind(s) at the other end of said process, or if you prefer of the information stored by those brain(s). Of course, one can argue that some kinds of knowledge -- like the kinds you and I know? -- are vastly more important than others, but such a claim is usually more snobbery than fact. Furthermore, a society with more such computational and mental diversity is more productive, because specialized algorithms, mental processes, and skills are generally far more productive than generalized ones. As Friedrich Hayek pointed out, our mutual inability to understand a very high fraction of what others know has profound implications for our economic and political institutions. * A big problem in the last few years has been the poor recording of transfers of ownership of mortgages (i.e. of the debt not the house). The issue of recording transfers of contractual rights is very interesting. I have a proposal for this, secure property titles. This should work just as well for mortgage securities and other kinds of transferable contractual rights as it does for the real estate itself or other kinds of property. Anytime you transfer rights to a contract it should be registered in such a secure and reliable public database in order to avoid the risk of not being able to prove ownership in court. * Not only should you disagree with others, but you should disagree with yourself. Totalitarian thought asks us to consider, much less accept, only one hypothesis at a time. By contrast quantum thought, as I call it -- although it already has a traditional name less recognizable to the modern ear, scholastic thought -- demands that we simultaneoulsy consider often mutually contradictory possibilities. Thinking about and presenting only one side's arguments gives one's thought and prose a false patina of consistency: a fallacy of thought and communications similar to false precision, but much more common and imporant. Like false precision, it can be a mental mistake or a misleading rhetorical habit. In quantum reality, by contrast, I can be both for and against a proposition because I am entertaining at least two significantly possible but inconsistent hypotheses, or because I favor some parts of a set of ideas and not others. If you are unable or unwilling to think in such a quantum or scholastic manner, it is much less likely that your thoughts are worthy of others' consideration. 
Justice John Paul Stevens has riled up law professors everywhere by reiterating the traditional doctrine of the common law, namely that the case-by-case decisionmaking that has given rise to the common law, as well as other precedent-based law such as interpretation of the United States Constitution, is a process of discovering something that already, in a Platonic sense, exists:[T]he source of a "new rule" is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law. Accordingly, the underlying right necessarily pre-exists our articulation of the new rule. This contradicts the modern academic dogma of "positivism" in which the common law is made, not discovered, and therefore cannot be said to exist in any sense until the decision comes down.  This is associated with another dogma, "realism", in which judicial decisions are largely just, as with legislation, exercises in political power.Legal academics make far too much out of the "made" vs. "discovered" dichotomy.  We can see that by looking at the supposed distinction between "discovering" a law of science and "inventing" a new piece of technology.  If it's possible to make a strong and important distinction between "discovering" and "making", we should be able to do so here. Yet our patent system would not have been able to transition so smoothly to being able to patent new breeds of plant or new strands of DNA if this distinction were so clear.   In patent law the distinction between a "discovered" law and a "made" invention can be as trivial as the distinction between a "discovery" that a high level of a certain hormone correlates with a high risk of a certain disease and the "invention" of a test that allows one to detect the high hormone level and algorithmically (or perhaps even mentally -- it's unresolved law) conclude that one is at serious risk of the disease.  In other words, no serious difference at all -- the test apparatus and the mental or algorithmic step was how the discovery was made.  To make the discovery is to make the invention, and vice versa, and the idea that there is an strong and important distinction between the two here is risible.There are thus cases in which the distinction between making and discovering is trivial.  But we can readily and fruitfully think of all invention as discovery.   What was more important to inventing the first automobile: the physical making and combining of its parts, or the discoveries of ways make and combine them (in this case, discovering what are the better and worse ways to combine an internal combustion engine with a carriage)?  One can discover better and worse ways of making things just as one can discover new continents or planets.  That, and not whether the physical machine has actually been built, and thus can be said to now physically "exist", lies at the heart of invention.   Furthermore, there is a Platonic sense in which these better or worse designs already exist, because the basic laws by which they operate already exist: the designs be deduced from the laws of physics and the history of the part of the universe in which it is desired that they operate.  In practice, it this process of discovery requires its own empirical tests: build the machine, try it in the various desired environments, tweak the machine to make it work better.  As with discovery those laws themselves, inventors hypothesize which designs are better or worse and test them against reality.  They don't exercise their will and arbitrarily decide which machines will work better and which will not.So too, common law is a painstaking way of discovering and making better law, case by case, dispute by dispute, piece of evidence by piece of evidence.  For machines there is a Platonic "environment space", the set of environments we desire those machines to work in.   As we explore new environments we discover new ways to make machines work better in them.    In common law, there is a "facts space", a Platonic space of possible unique disputes, each with its own unique set of facts.   It is not possible to explore more than a miniscule fraction of the facts space.  Instead of the hubristic exercise of waving one's hands calling for "Change" and then drafting broad legislation, the ultimate consequences of which are usually unknown, common law judges tweak the common law.  In each case they are discovering a better way in which the law can be made.   Just as there are empirically better and worse machines, so there are empirically better and worse laws.    If the law applied to the facts of this case is unjust, it needs to be tweaked.  Not repealed or overruled, as the absolutist minds of positivists would have -- but tweaked -- by a shade of meaning or an exception for a new situation.  To repeal a rule of common law insults the combined wisdom of several previous courts and a variety of cases with their own large bodies of evidence not before the current court.   It's like an octopus declaring that, based on his discovery that wheeled vehicles don't work on the ocean, that they won't work on land either, despite many landlubbers who've reported that wheeled vehicles work on land just fine.   The principles of precedent or stare decisis allow the law to evolve towards worker better in an ever wider variety of disputes, even though only the facts of one case can be observed at a time.So there is no dichotomy -- judges both make law and discover law.   By not doing so in broad brushstrokes, they can avoid doing the broad unintended harms that legislation usually causes.  Legislation purposefully disrupts previously existing legal rights and duties wholesale.  Proper common law precedent -- any precedent that should be respected -- never should do this.   Instead it should be clarifying the nature of previously unexplored territories of the facts space, the space of possible disputes, and tweak the law so that it works better in the newly explored part of the facts sapce.   Incremental discovery of better law justifies the prohibition against ex post facto laws applying to legislation in a way that it does not apply to common law making.N.B.: the fact that scientific discoveries are called "laws", by metaphor to human laws, should clue us in as to what people generally thought about the nature of law at the time of the scientific revolution, i.e. from the Renaissance through the Enlightenment, and including the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution.Labels: common law, law, legal positivism, legal realism, natural law
G.K. Chesterton ponders a fence:In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."This paradox rests on the most elementary common sense. The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease. But the truth is that nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served. But if he simply stares at the thing as a senseless monstrosity that has somehow sprung up in his path, it is he and not the traditionalist who is suffering from an illusion.Contrast the sunk cost fallacy, according to one account: When one makes a hopeless investment, one sometimes reasons: I can’t stop now, otherwise what I’ve invested so far will be lost. This is true, of course, but irrelevant to whether one should continue to invest in the project. Everything one has invested is lost regardless. If there is no hope for success in the future from the investment, then the fact that one has already lost a bundle should lead one to the conclusion that the rational thing to do is to withdraw from the project.The sunk cost fallacy, according to another account:Picture this: It's the evening of the Lady Gaga concert/Yankees game/yoga bootcamp. You bought the tickets months ago, saving up and looking forward to it. But tonight, it's blizzarding and you've had the worst week and are exhausted. Nothing would make you happier than a hot chocolate and pajamas, not even 16-inch pink hair/watching Jeter/nailing the dhanurasana.But you should go, anyway, right? Because otherwise you'd be "wasting your money"?Think again. Economically speaking, you shouldn't go.Has Chesterton committed the sunk cost fallacy? Consider the concept of proxy measures:The process of determining the value of a product from observations is necessarily incomplete and costly. For example, a shopper can see that an apple is shiny red. This has some correlation to its tastiness (the quality a typical shopper actually wants from an apple), but it's hardly perfect. The apple's appearance is not a complete indicator -- an apple sometimes has a rotten spot down inside even if the surface is perfectly shiny and red. We call an indirect measure of value -- for example the shininess, redness, or weight of the apple -- a proxy measure. In fact, all measures of value, besides prices in an ideal market, are proxy measures -- real value is subjective and largely tacit.Cost can usually be measured far more objectively than value. As a result, the most common proxy measures are various kinds of costs. Examples include:(a) paying for employment in terms of time worked, rather than by quantity produced (piece rates) or other possible measures. Time measures sacrifice, i.e. the cost of opportunities foregone by the employee(b) most numbers recorded and reported by accountants for assets are costs rather than market prices expected to be recovered by the sale of assets. (c) non-fiat money and collectibles obtain their value primarily from their scarcity, i.e. their cost of replacement.Proxy measures are important because we usually can't measure value directly, much less forecast future value with high confidence. And often we know little of the evidence and preferences that went into an investment decision. You may have forgotten or (if the original decision maker was somebody else) never learned the reason. In which case, the original decision-maker may have had more knowledge than you do -- especially if that decision-maker was somebody else, but sometimes even if that decision-maker was you. In which case it can make a great deal of sense to use the sunk cost as a proxy measure of value.In the first account of sunk cost, there seems to be no uncertainty: by definition we know that our investment is "hopeless." In such a case, valuing our sunk costs is clearly erroneous. But the second, real-world example, is far less clear: "you've had the worst week and are exhausted.." Does this mean you won't enjoy the concert, as you originally envisioned? Or does it mean that in your exhaustion you've forgotten why you wanted to go to the concert? If it's more likely to mean the latter, then my generalization of Chesterton's fence, using the idea of proxy measures, suggests that you should use your sunk costs as a proxy measure of value, and weigh that value against the costs of the blizzard and the benefits of hot chocolate and pajamas, to decide whether you still will be made happier by going to the concert. If your evidence may be substantially incomplete you shouldn't just ignore sunk costs -- they contain valuable information about decisions you or others made in the past, perhaps after much greater thought or access to evidence than that of which you are currently capable. Even more generally, you should be loss averse -- you should tend to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring seemingly equivalent gains, and you should be divestiture averse (i.e. exhibit endowment effects) -- you should tend to prefer what you already have to what you might trade it for -- in both cases to the extent your ability to measure the value of the two items is incomplete. Since usually in the real world, and to an even greater degree in our ancestors' evolutionary environments, our ability to measure value is and was woefully incomplete, it should come as no surprise that people often value sunk costs, are loss averse, and exhibit endowment effects -- and indeed under such circumstances of incomplete value measurement it hardly constitutes "fallacy" or "bias" to do so.In short, Chesterton's fence and proxy measures suggest that taking into account sunk costs, or more generally being averse to loss or divestiture, rather than always being a fallacy or irrational bias, may often lead to better decisions: indeed if it is done in just those cases where substantial evidence or shared preferences that motivated the original investment decision have been forgotten or have not been communicated, or otherwise where the quality of evidence that led to that decision may outweigh the quality of evidence that is motivating one to change one's mind.. We generally have far more information about our past than about our future. Decisions that have already been made, by ourselves and others, are an informative part of that past, especially when their original motivations have been forgotten.References:Chesterton's FenceSunk Cost Fallacy  (1), (2) Endowment Effects/Divestiture Aversion:  Loss Aversion: Cost as a Proxy Measure of Value
Robin Hanson has a good argument about the inevitability of Malthusian economics in our future -- here refined by Anders Sandberg.  This Malthusian future is distant in human terms but an eyeblink in cosmic terms.  Sandberg observes that that our cosmic environment, while very large, is finite and dispersed.  Emigration beyond our solar system can expand these resources only polynomially, which can't keep up with exponential economic or population growth.   Therefore, our current boom era of exponential economic growth, wherein manufacturing productivity has grown at about the same positive percentage rate per year starting in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages, is historically very unique and must eventually come to an end.  Furthermore, Hanson argues that the specter of Malthus, purged in the late 20th century by declining fertility, will return -- Darwinian genetic adaptation to modern fertility-reducing conditions and technologies will eventually bring population growth rates back to exponentially positive rates until once again resource limits are reached and most humans (or posthumans) live at subsistence levels -- very extreme poverty by the standards of modern developed countries.The Darwinian argument may be overcome if culture keeps evolving faster than genes and thereby can keep overcoming future genetic adaptations.  (Richard Dawkins argues that we can overcome our selfish genes).   It may be rebutted that units of culture (what Dawkins calls "memes") themselves are Darwinian competitors and thus also face Malthusian limits, or that future computerized minds may reproduce very quickly and evolve as fast as culture. I won't elaborate on these arguments further here as Robin has got me into a hyper-futuristic mood and I'd like to suggest another way in which we might achieve more "room at the bottom".Hanson counts atoms in order to estimate the density of information (or of minds) that might be created.  But, just as Freeman Dyson, Gerard O'Neill, and others showed that planets are a waste of mass, so that technologically mature civilizations won't have planets, I'll argue here that atoms are a waste of mass-energy, and technologically mature civilizations may not have very many of them.  Instead information may be stored in photons and collections of electrons and positrons (for example geonium) may handle most information processing and form the substrate of minds.Given that a photon can come in a vast number of possibly distinguishable frequencies, the spectrum spanning more than 20 orders of magnitude, we may be able to store at least 10^30 bits per photon.  One approach to creating photons is to simply capture the energy of solar nuclear fusions as photons, as we already know how to do -- this should give us about 10^95 bits worth of photons of average energy blue.  But we'd have to either wait billions of years for all these fusion reactions to occur naturally in the sun or accelerate them somehow.   More completely, the neutrons and protons in the sun, if converted into photons of average energy blue, would give us 10^97 bits and we may not have to wait billions of years if we can figure out how to bring about this hypothetical conversion.  This is a fascinating but very speculative bit of physics which I will explore further.Of course, we will still need some electrons or positrons around to actually process that information and recycle photons.   And we still need some neutrons and protons around to fuse for energy to make up for the waste heat, to the extent that geonium computations will be less than perfectly reversible.   Unless we are very clever and figure out how to make solid structures that don't blow up out of electrons and positrons, we will need some magnetic tanks made out of traditional heavy atoms to hold the geonium.  Worse, the strong tendency for baryon number to be conserved makes cracking protons difficult and perhaps impossible.  Protons are made out of three quarks, and while cracking quarks is quite possible (particles with two quarks but zero net baryon number decay spontaneously into particles with no quarks), the tendency for baryon numbers to be conserved at the energy levels used by current particle accelerators suggests that cracking the proton, if we can even figure out how to do it, may require vast amounts of energy, so that only a tiny fraction of the sun's neutrons and protons might be converted before we run out of energy from the fusion of the remaining nuclei.  Right now we know how to crack the neutron into a proton and electron, but we don't know how to crack the proton.  To be feasible we will have to discover a way to "catalyze" proton decay, by analogy to how the activation energies of chemical reactions can be lowered by catalysts.If feasible, converting wasteful atoms into more useful photons would give us many orders of magnitude more room at the bottom.  Staving off Malthus then becomes a question of how much information can be stored in a photon, and of how quickly electrons or positrons can process those photons.We still face Heisenberg uncertainty as a limit on how quickly these photonic memories can be recalled.  The product of the measured time of arrival of a photon and its measured energy (and thus the number of distinguishable frequencies) has a fixed uncertainty -- if we measure the time with greater precision, we can distinguish fewer frequencies, and vice versa.  This sets a finite limit on the rate at which we can process the information stored in the photons.  Seth Lloyd has calculated that 1 kilogram of mass converted into energy can perform at most 10^50 operations per second.  So future civilizations could only stave off Malthus by going photonic -- Malthus will still eventually catch up, assuming Darwinian competition in reproduction remains.In addition to classical bits stored as photon frequencies, an exponentially higher number of quantum bits (qubits) might be stored in the entangled states of these photons.   However, to use some number of these qubits requires destroying an exponentially larger amount of them.   Thus, against exponential population growth memory storage itself remains cheap, but recalling memories or thinking about things becomes exponentially expensive.  Qubit minds might stave off Malthus by hibernating for exponentially longer periods of time, waking up only to observe an exponentially decreasing number of interesting events.My argument that we may figure out how to crack three-quark particles like neutrons and protons into photons relies on the probability, due to the imbalance of protons and anti-protons (and neutrons and anti-neutrons) in the observable universe, that baryon number (a property of quarks) is not necessarily conserved, and is falsifiable in that sense: if for example we discover with better telescopes that the amount of antimatter in the universe is the same as the amount of matter, that will at least strongly suggest that even at Big Bang energies baryon number is conserved, rendering the possibility of ever converting the quarks which constitute most of the mass of neutrons and protons into non-quarkish things (like electrons, positrons or photons) extremely unlikely.   It's also somewhat imminently testable insofar as if LHC and similar colliders continue to fail to crack the proton, that further dims prospects.  Feasibility, however, is not so testable: one could argue that, even if baryon number was not conserved in the Big Bang, and even if we soon discover how to crack the proton in high-energy colliders, we may never figure out a method, analogous to catalysis in chemical reactions, to crack protons at economically low energies or to productively recycle the energies used to perform the conversions rather than it being dispersed as waste heat. (h/t: the phrase "Cosmic Malthus" to describe Hanson's theory is from commenter Norman at Robin's blog).
This blog is named "Unenumerated" for a variety of reasons, including(1) the  Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states the most basic (but most ignored) law of the United States, namely that our civil rights, which should be enforced by the courts, are so vast and varied that they cannot be enumerated, and(2) the list of topics for this blog, which is so vast and varied that it cannot be enumerated.
Research In Motion, Ltd. of Canada, which lost a very big (both in terms of dollars and legal precedent) case to NTP, Inc., over NTP's patent for a distributed e-mail system, has now asked the United States Supreme Court to hear the case. The big legal issue is how to determine patent infringement when distributed systems (for example, Internet protocols) span borders.Specifically, the issue under United States patent law is whether a system claim (or method claim) of a United States patent can be infringed when some features of the working system are located outside United States territory, but most the system elements or method steps are located within the United States, as are users. In this case a part of the system (and at least one of the steps of the method) corresponds to RIM's relay located in Canada; the other elements or steps (BlackBerries and the operations performed on them) and the users at issue are located within the United States. Another issue is whether RIM's infringement was direct or contributory infringement. A third issue is whether any international law is implicated.  If only some elements or steps need to be in a country to infringe a patent in that country, the operator of a patented protocol spanning two or more countries might be sued for infringing the same patent in two or more countries.  There is a grave danger that the patent holder could recover far more damages than it would otherwise be entitled to.  To avoid this, the international law principle of comity might have to be invoked to determine which country has jurisdiction.  On the other hand, if all the elements or steps must be in a single country in order to infringe a patent, this leaves a loophole whereby makers of distributed systems can ignore patents as long as some of the features are located in different countries.When the Federal Circuit, which has jurisdiction over patent appeals in U.S. patent infringement cases, first heard the case it said that the system claim was indeed directly infringed. It then reheard the case and decided that the method claim was not infringed.  Their opinion was based on precedent from two older cases. The first case held that a system claim for a navigation system used in international waters was infringed because it was controlled from the United States. The second case held that a manufacturing process claim was not infringed if one of the steps was performed in Japan. As a result of the dubious analogy of these two precedents (there are no binding cases more on-point) the Federal Circuit has somewhat illogically distinguished between a claim for a distributed algorithm and the same claim restyled as a distributed system.  My own opinion is that, until a treaty is signed to say otherwise, all the elements and steps should have to be within the United States in order to infringe a United States patent.  This leaves a loophole in patent law, but that's better than the injustices and international law issues that are raised by courts reaching across borders to find infringement in remote Internet servers.  Furthermore, if what RIM did is considered infringement it should classified as contributory not direct infringement. RIM's customers may be "using" the patent "within the United States," but RIM itself is not.  RIM would however be contributing to the infringement by providing the BlackBerries and running their e-mail relay and thus would still be liable.   In other circumstances with no contributory infningement, however, it would be a grave injustice to find direct infringement in the United States because one was simply operating one element or step of the United States patent overseas.The case before the Supreme Couret is now denoted Research In Motion, Ltd. v. NTP, Inc., Supreme Court No. 05-763, opinion below, NTP, Inc. v. Research In Motion, Ltd., 418 F.3d 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2005).Read more information on this case here.
To what extent can law be mechanized? This author, Mark Miller, Lawrence Lessig, and others have proposed that software code can provide a substitute, to a greater or lesser degree, for various kinds of legal rules, especially in new software-driven areas such as the Internet. Indeed software increasingly provides a de facto set of law-like rules governing human interaction even when we don't intend such a result.This post proposes a framework for mechanical laws in physical spaces inspired by the traditional English common law of trespass (roughly what today is called in common law countries the "intentional torts," especially trespass and battery).Several decades ago, Isaac Asimov posited three laws to be programmed into robots:1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law, and3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.I reject these as an approach for analyzing the mechanization of law because (i) they represent a law of robot servants towards human masters, which is quite different from my present goal of analyzing the mechanization of laws among equals (whether equal as fellow property or equal as fellow property owner), and (ii) they are hopelessly subjective and computationally intractible. How does a robot determine when a human has been "harmed"? Even if that problem was solved how does a robot predict when a human will come to harm, much less how to avoid their own actions causing such harm, much less what actions will lead to avoidance of that harm? While Asimov attempted to address some of these issues in various oversimplified scenarios in his stories, this is no substitute for the real-world experience of actual disputes and settlements, and the resulting precedents and the evolution of rules.Thus I propose to substitute for Asimov's Laws a framework which (1) is based on a real-world, highly evolved system of law that stressed concrete and objective rules rather than abstract, ambiguous, and subjective ethical precepts, (2) is "peer-to-peer" rather than "master-servant", and (3) is based, as much as possible, not on hypothetical human-like "artificial intelligence," but on a framework much of which can be tested with hardware and simple algorithms resembling those we possess today. Indeed, a prototype of this system can probably be developed using Lego(tm) robot kits, lasers, photosensors, sonar, video cameras, and other off-the-shelf hardware along with some custom computer programming using known algorithms.Using such a prototype framework I hope that we can test out new legal rules and political systems in contests without harming actual humans. I also hope that we can test the extent to which law can be mechanized and to which security technology can prevent or provide strong evidence for breaches of law.What about possible application to real-world security systems and human laws? In technical terms, I don't expect most of these mechanical laws to be applied in a robotic per se fashion to humans, but rather mostly to provide better notice and gather better evidence, perhaps in the clearest cases creating a prima facie case shifting the burden of lawsuit and/or the burden of proof to the person against whom clear evidence of law-breaking has been gathered. The system may also be used to prototype "smart treaties" governing weapons systems.The main anthropomorphic assumption we will make is the idea that our robots can be motivated by incentives, e.g. by the threat of loss of property or of personal damage or destruction. If this seems unrealistic, think of our robots as being agents of humans who after initially creating the robots are off-stage. Under contest rules the humans have an incentive to program their robots to avoid damage to themselves as well as to avoid monetary penalties against their human owners; thus we can effectively treat the robots as being guided (within the limits of flexibility and forethought of simple algorithms) by such incentives.The traditional trespasses are based on surfaces: a trespass on real property breaks a spatial boundary of that property, and a battery touches the skin or clothes or something closely attached to same (such as a tool grasped in the hand). Corresponding to such laws we have have developed a variety of security devices such as doors, locks, fences, etc. that provide notice of a surface and sometimes provide evidence that such a surface has been forceably crossed. The paradigmatic idea is "tres-pass", Law French for "big step": a crossing of a boundary that, given the notice and affordances provided, the trespasser knew or should have know was a violation of law. In our model, robots should have been programmed to not cross such boundaries without owner consent or other legal authority, ideas to be explored further below.One way to set up this system is as contests between human programmers deploying their robots into the robot legal system. In a partially automated system there would be some human-refereed "police" and "courts," but an ideal fully-automated version would run without human intervention. Under contest rules in the fully-automated mode, after the human creators, who had an incentive to program the robots to respond to incentives, are done with their programming and the contest has commenced, only robots and other things exist in this robotic legal system. Only robots are legal persons; as such they can own other things and devices as well as spatial regions and things fixed therein (real property).For each type of tort in my robot legal system, I propose a class of surface or other physical condition and correspondong class(es) of sensors:(1) battery : physical surface of the robot (sensor detects touch). This touching must be the result of a physical trajectory that was probably not accidental (e.g. bumping a fellow robot on within a crowded space is probably not a battery).(2) trespass to real property : three-dimensional surface of laser-break sensors bounding a space owned by a robot, or other location-finding sensors that can detect boundary crossings.(3) trespass or conversion of moveable property: involves touch sensors for trespass to chattels; security against coversion probably also involves using RFID, GPS, or more generally proplets in the moveable property. But this is a harder problem, so call it TBD.(4) assault is a credible threat of imminent battery : probably involves active and passive viewing devices such as radar, sonar and video and corresponding movement detection and pattern recognition. Specifics TBD (another harder problem).Note that we have eliminated subjective elements such as "intent" and "harm." The idea is to replace these with deductiions from physical evidence that can be gathered by sensors. For example, evidence of a boundary crossing with force often in itself (per se) implies probable intent, and in such cases intent can be dispensed with as a conjunctive element or can be automatically inferred. With well-designed physical triggering conditions and notices and affordances to avoid them, we can avoid subjective elements that would require human judgment and still reach the right verdict in the vast majority of cases. In real world law such notices, affordances, and evidence-gathering would allow us to properly assign the burden of lawsuit to the prima facie  lawbreaker so that a non-frivolous lawsuit would only occur in a miniscule fraction of cases.   Thus security systems adapted to and even simulating real-world legal rules could greatly lower legal costs, but it is to be doubted that they could be entirely automated without at least some residual injustice.Our robotic contract law is simply software code that the robots generated (or their human programmers have previously coded) and agree to abide by, i.e. smart contracts. Three basic legal defenses (or justifications) for a surface break, taking of moveable property, or assault are:(1) consent by the owner, expressed or implied (the former requires only some standard protocol that describes the surface and conditions for activity within that surface, i.e. a smart contract; I'm not sure what the latter category, implied consent, is in robot-land, but the "bumping in a crowded space" is probably an example of implied consent to a touch).(2) self-defense (which may under certain circumstances include defense of property if the victim was illegally within a surface at the time), or(3) other legal authorization.The defense (3) of legal authorization is the most interesting and relates strongly to how robots are incentivized, i.e. punished and how robots are compensated for damages. In other words, what are the "police" and "courts" that enforce the law in this robotic world? Such a punishment is itself an illegal trespass unless it is legally authorized. The defense of legal authorization is also strongly related to the defense (2) of self-defense. That will be the topic, I hope, of a forthcoming post.
After a long stint of research and thought I have returned to share some of the results.In the early 19th century the Reverend Thomas Malthus, foreshadowing Charles Darwin, wrote:Throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms Nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand but has been comparatively sparing in the room and the nourishment necessary to rear them.  The germs of existence contained in this earth if they could freely develop themselves would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years.  Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law and man cannot by any efforts of reason escape from it ... Wherever therefore there is liberty the power of increase is exerted and the superabundant effects are repressed afterwards by want of room and nourishment.This is the Malthusian trap: any improvements in institutions, technologies, or any other improvement in labor productivity will over the course of a few generations increase the population until it once again flirts with subsistence levels.  Delayed marriage and plagues can delay or reverse such population growth for a time and produce higher than subsistence standards of living, but, with some small variations (see diagram below), eventually our Darwinian proclivity to procreate will return our descendants back to subsistence levels.   But just as Malthus was writing, his Great Britains were becoming the first living things to ever break free of the Malthusian trap.   As a result, in the 21st century the developed world has both populations and standards of living never before achieved. We can picture the progress of civilization in Malthusian terms.   Click to enlarge and examine this schematic diagram: Click to enlarge.In this chart, the horizontal axis represents, on a logarithmic scale, the human population per area of land adjusted for natural (but not artificial) variability in its potential to support human food production.  Such an adjusted area is typically called by ecologists a "global hectare" and my phrase "natural global hectare" represents a hypothetical measure of this independent of all human labor and capital improvements.The vertical axis represents per capita nutrition derived, via human labor and capital, from this ecology.  The slope line or "labor productivity isocline" represents, intuitively speaking, a level of civilization.  In other words, a level of technological and institutional progress. More specifically, it represents food production output per worker (productivity) adjusted for the marginality of ecology being used.   As the isoclines move up and right, a given unit of labor is producing more human nutrition from the same global hectare.   So our own 21st century agriculture is far more productive than 19th century British agriculture, which in turn was far more productive than medieval European agricultural, which in turn was more productive than Neolithic agriculture, which in turn was more productive than hunting and gathering.As we move along a given isocline (a given "level of civilization" as just described) we experience the Malthusian tradeoff: more population per global hectare with lower nutrition, or less population per global hectare with higher nutrition.   As we escape from the Malthusian trap, nutrition itself becomes satisfied and the left axis really represents a more general per capita income.   Prior to escaping from the Malthusian trap, nutrition dominated the average human budget with fuel (mostly to cook food), clothing, shelter, etc. usually less than 20% of a personal budget or the overall economy.A number of interesting patterns emerge from this kind of analysis.   First, roving bandit societies such as hunter-gatherers and pastoral nomads tended to have lower population levels and higher per-capita nutrition than stationary bandit societies (settled agriculture).  The Western European Dark Ages is an interesting intermediate case.   This certainly suggests that most prior analyses of Malthusian tradeoffs, which have focused on pure economics, are very incomplete -- that security and politics play a crucial role, and not just in the trivial sense wars and other causes of mortality.  There are good reasons of security of property and capital investments to expect this difference between roving and stationary bandits, as I hope to describe in future post(s).The main question I hope to answer in forthcoming posts is: why did our escape from the Malthusian trap happen when and where it did, and not elsewhere?   This will probably involve exploring a wide variety of technologies and institutions and especially the key factors of capital investment and security.One obvious possible answer -- and the most likely reason humans will continue departing from the Malthusian trap for some time to come -- is birth control.  But the British population up to the late 19th century was booming and seldom made effective use of birth control, so this can't explain Great Britain's initial escape from the Malthusian trap.  A second answer is to invoke the industrial revolution.  But this is a vague term and risks getting at least some of the causation backwards, as one of the factors enabling the industrial revolution was a large swelling of the British industrial work force because improving farm labor productivity meant that fewer farm workers could feed more people.   And it neglects a third crucial factor, the transportation revolution.   And it risks focusing on technology when institutional changes played a crucial role.   All of which I hope to explore and to discuss with my readers.Meanwhile, for now I leave you with the following fascinating looks at London and Beijing early in the 20th century.   See if you can spot a difference between the two societies which I find crucial.  Indeed it is visually obvious and is implicit in a theme of the Chinese documentary.  The internal combustion engines are irrelevant for our pre-20th-century purposes.  Escape from the Malthusian trap was well underway by the early 19th century and the difference I have in mind had existed to some extent at least for many centuries.  But if you're into more trivial pursuits see if you can spot the two "horseless carriages" on the London streets. London in the 1900s:Beijing and some other Chinese locales in the 1920s:
Here's a good video lesson on the difference between legal defense of people within a dwelling and murder in a castle doctrine state.  The narration by the announcer here is not clear: the unarmed (it turns out) robber goes down because the pharmacist (the defendant) has shot him in the head.   The armed robber flees without firing a shot.  The prosecution claims the unarmed robber then lay there unconscious, which is plausible given that the defendant turned his back on him.   The prosecutor argues (correctly, if we accept the prosecution's version of the facts) that the first shot to the head was proper self-defense, whereas the later five shots (the video is sped up) were not justifiable self-defense.  The defense argues that the injured robber was getting back up and thus, even though not brandishing a weapon (and as it turns out unarmed), could have posed a danger justifying the five shots that killed the injured robber.  From seeing on the video the pharmacist turn his back on that robber I'm skeptical of the defense's version of the facts, but that's up to the jury.Note that calling the police immediately afterward, as here, is a very good idea -- not calling the police as soon is one safely can is a very bad idea, suggesting guilt -- but it probably won't be enough in this case to save this guy from some jail time.Ignatius Piazza, a self-defense trainer, has a good collection of videos on this case.  Local TV station KRMG has a version with the prosecutor narrating the surveillance video (a much better but obviously biased narration).Not mentioned in these videos is that the armed robber who ran away was also and quite properly charged with murder -- what is called a felony murder, because he committed a felony that led to a death, even death caused by a victim of that felony as here.Technically, all the Oklahoma statute does is shift from the defendant the burden of proving "a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm" when killing somebody who has forcefully entered a dwelling or vehicle -- instead the prosecutor must prove that the fear was not reasonable.  Here, the burden of proof does shift to the prosecutor, but, again assuming the facts are as he claims, he should be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt either that the pharmacist in fact had no such fear, or that any such fear of harm from an unconscious man was unreasonable.  Even assuming the injured robber had regained consciousness, a much better course of action would have been to have the women at the back of the store call the police and to hold the gun to the robber's head until the police arrived.I strongly second Ignatius' advice that if you own a gun that you may one day have to use for self-defense, that you take a good training course.  Military training is not sufficient for this and indeed may have led this pharmacist, a military veteran, astray.  Military doctrine is a very different thing than the civilian law of self-defense and the castle doctrine.  I do take issue with Ignatius' simplistic description of a supposed "universal" rule for when self-defense is justified.  Some jurisdictions allow far more defense of self, others, and persons within dwellings or vehicles than he describes (especially castle doctrine and stand-your-ground states), and some allow less.   If you are going to have a gun around for self-defense, you should learn the laws of your own state, province, or country and you should train yourself accordingly.  The laws vary widely.   If you aren't willing to learn the laws and train accordingly, as this pharmacist apparently failed to do, you shouldn't keep a gun.   By using a gun against criminals you are, morally speaking, deputizing yourself as a law enforcer -- a very good thing, since the police usually can't get there in time to protect victims, but a status that comes with a moral responsibility to train yourself in how to legally use a gun. Self-defense and castle laws give you this authority; misusing these rights is what the prosecutor properly (again assuming his version of the facts) calls "exceeding authority" and thus murder.  Note that under the recent Heller Second Amendment case, self-defense and defense of others is a primary justification for our right to own a gun in the first place in the U.S.The castle doctrine under common law, as well as the quite related knock-and-announce rule for law enforcement, comes from Semayne's case:  "That the house of everyone is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence, as for his repose...if thieves come to a man's house to rob him, or murder, and the owner or his servants kill any of the thieves in defence of himself and his house it is not felony, and he shall lose nothing."   Modern castle statutes, such as Oklahoma's, often also apply this doctrine to businesses and vehicles.   The Wikipedia article on the U.S. castle doctrine has a list of states with stand-your-ground laws and castle laws, with links to the statutory texts.By the way, political scientists who define governments as entities having a "monopoly of force" are idiots.  I just thought I'd get in that shot of my own while I'm here.
A few years ago I wrote this introduction to a class of cryptographic protocols often called "multiparty secure computation."  Wikipedia now also has a good introduction.The basic idea is to perform a shared yet mutually private computation over the Internet.  The computation could be as simple as comparing ages or as complex as an audit or an auction.  In this shared computation, the inputs are mutually private, the output shared with all participants, and the privacy of the inputs does not depend on a trusted third party.  For example, Alice, Bob, and Charles can each input their ages into the protocol, and the protocol will output a result indicating who is the oldest, without any of them learning the actual age of any other.  They can only learn what they can deduce from their own input and the protocol's output.Here's a good page of links to papers on the subject.  There have been some very useful breakthroughs since I wrote on the subject, including orders-of-magnitude improvements in speed and security improvements in terms of how many parties must collude to fake a result or deny a party access to the output.
Ten ways to be an effective political activist, in  a roughly decreasing order of importance:1. Be prepared to vote with your feet. Add interstate and international diversity to your social networks -- both personal and business. Lower your costs of exiting, if the need should arise, the jurisdictions that impose on the territories wherein you reside. Repeatedly in history -- from the old American frontier to the fall of the Berlin Wall to modern jurisdictions that specialize in international trade -- low exit costs have not only enabled liberty for the individual and the small group, but they have more than any other factor motivated the larger jurisdiction to provide the most important rights and freedoms for those who stay put. Grow interpolitical roots so that no single polity can chop down your tree. The good news is that modern communications, travel, and standardization of international languages (mostly on English) have made diversifying our social networks -- growing international roots -- far easier than ever before in history.2. Influence our law in action. Serve on a jury and insist on protecting those who have not been proven to harm or intend to harm another.3. Make your own law. For starters draft your own contracts, wills, prenuptial agreements, and property deeds. Even better if you can do this as a service for other people, but for that you will generally need to be a member of the appropriate legal guild. To draft law usefully, whether for yourself or others, you will need to learn the real law they don't normally teach in public schools: contracts, property, trusts and estates, and torts for starters, or else (often a second best choice to learning law yourself) retain the services of a sympathetic lawyer. Learn actual law -- don't turn into a whacko running around putting liens on other people's property based on interpretations of the UCC quite remote from what any judge would contemplate. But do start to make your own law. You cannot be free if you cannot make your own law.4. Influence our law in action. Donate to or get involved with the Institute for Justice and other organizations of politically and legally savvy people defending our most important rights and freedoms in the courts.5. Make your own law: use strong security to protect the people, relationships, property, and data you value. Learn to defend yourself and your loved ones with weaponry. Write and use cryptography, smart contracts, bit gold, digital cash, and other security protocols made possible by computer science.6.  Tell us about your good research and good ideas: write a blog, comment on a blog, write papers.7.  Start a multinational small business.8. Vote with your pocketbook -- buy and sell the goods, services, stocksand bonds that promote liberty, and boycott those that promote itsviolation.9. Get involved in a lobbying group or political campaign where you can make a difference: usually a local campaign, but on rare occasions a national one.10. Vote for and against politicians, but don't be fooled -- of all theseten ways to make a political difference, voting in a political election makes theleast difference.
The Roman Empire was a military dictatorship.  Its emperors came and went in a relentless spree of assassinations and civil wars (example) that lasted for nearly 1500 years.   One and one-half millennia of violent government extended across history from the victories of Octavian (a.k.a. Caesar Augustus) over his rivals in decades before Christ to the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453.   Despite the violence, or perhaps because of it, Roman elites accumulated vast surpluses and left spectacular monuments unmatched until much later in European history.By the opening of the 6th century the city of Rome itself was no longer a part of the Empire.  Instead Italy was ruled by the Goths and the capital city of the remaining empire, “Romania”,  was Constantinople.  This city (in modern times called Istanbul) controlled the strategic straights linking the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.  No topics dominated the culture of Constantinople so much as (1) the horse races, and (2) the debate over the relative contributions of the divine and the human to the nature of Christ.The debate over the nature of Christ divided Christians into numerous sects: Orthodox Catholics, Monophysites, Arians, Manicheans, Nestorians, and many others.   The Orthodox Catholics believed that Christ was both God and man, Monophysites divine only, Arians human only, and there were a dizzying number of variations on and nuances to these dogmas.    Theology was the hottest topic of debate and biggest motivation for political division and persecution in Constantinople.   Constantinople was dominated by Orthodox Catholics and Monophysites, while the Arian heresy held by the Goths and Vandals that had taken over the Western part of the Empire was considered a heresy beyond the pale.   Other positions, such as Manicheaism, were sometimes tolerated and sometimes not.With the coming to power of Christianity the brutal gladiatorial fights had been suppressed and horse racing was now the dominant spectator sport.   The Hippodrome in Constantinople was the main place of public gathering.    Spectators  shouted political opinions at the emperor, who in turn used the crowd to gauge public opinion.   Indeed, for the normal citizen, this was the only form of political participation.   The racing teams and their colors – Red, White, Blue, Green – dated far back to the early Empire.  By the 6th century, the two dominant teams were the Blues and the Greens.     The political nature of the Hippodrome had converted their fans into political factions.    The Blues tended to be government types, land owners, and Orthodox Catholics (or, during the frequent schisms with Rome, Chalcedonians).  Greens tended to be merchants and Monophysites.During the reign of Anastasius, in a village in Illyria (probably in modern Macedonia just north of modern Greece), where the natives still spoke a passable Latin, lived a young peasant bachelor.   Instead of taking up farming he left the village and came to Constantinople to join the army.    Dropping his humble family name and styling himself “Justin” – “just man” -- he fought in several wars and was promoted through the ranks of the palace guards.   Eventually he was promoted to Count (head) of the Excubitors, one of the two palace guard groups.  Justin then adopted his nephew, one Petrus Sabbatius, and brought him to Constantinople.   Sabbatius too dropped his humble name and, aspiring to the achievements of his uncle and benefactor, restyled himself “Justinian”.   Justin’s master, the emperor Anastatius, was a Green and Monophysite.  Justin, and to an even greater degree his nephew, were Orthodox Catholics (or during the schism of the time Chalcedonians) who supported the Blue faction.Anastasius failed to make formal provisions for the succession.   His death in 518 threw Constantiople into confusion, as none his three nephews had strong support.    The Manichean eunuch Amantius, Chamberlain to Anastasius, hoped to be a power behind the throne of his chosen puppet,  an obscure character named Theocritus.   The palace guards had traditionally dominated the succession in Rome,  so Amantius needed the support of at least one of the two palace guard groups, the Excubitors and the Scholarians.  Justin, head of the Excubitors, secretly promised to support Theocritus and took money from Amantius to bribe the support of influential fence-sitters.  But instead of carrying out this secret plot, Justin lobbied and bullied the Blues, their Senate allies (most Senators were Blue), and his own soldiers.   Finally winning acclamation of most of the Blues in the Hippodrome, and fearful acquiescence of the Greens, Justin assumed the purple robes of emperor.Roman imperial successions had always been highly irregular, but the ideal of authority that other political players would most accept is suggested by Justin’s letter, upon assuming power, to the Pope in Rome: “We have been elected to the Empire by the favor of the indivisible Trinity, by the choice of the highest ministers of the sacred Palace, and of the Senate, and finally by the election of the army.”To cover his tracks, Justin had Amantius and Theocritus executed, under the pretext that Amantius (a heretic Manichean, but tolerated under Anastatius) had insulted the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople.  He named his nephew Count of the Domestics.  Justinian was a, or perhaps the, power behind the throne.   Falling in love with a repentant prostitute, Theodora, he had Justin’s quaestor, Proclus, cleverly draft a law that allowed him to marry a former prostitute while still forbidding such a degrading marriage to other Senators.Early in 527 AD, Justin fell sick and named Justinian Augustus (co-ruler) and successor. A few months later, Justin died and Justinian at age 45 became emperor.The former Petrus Sabbatius was to lavish his adoptive name and the empire's treasure on cities new and old, grand buildings, and wars of reconquest.   Most importantly for our purposes, Justinian would plaster his just-sounding name on a recompilation of Roman law that has profoundly shaped the West down to our own time.Coming: Tribonian, John of Cappadocia, revolt, massacre, prostration, and the the birth of a bloody code.ReferencesProcopius, Anecdota (Secret History)Procopius, History of the WarsJ.B.

From my article Advances in Distributed Security:Broadcasts using sound or radiation, from sources such as bell towers, radio towers, satellites, and pulsars, must send out the same value to every receiver. A remote beacon such as a pulsar has perfect security: the access structure is any party, and its complement, the attack structure, is the empty set. For human controlled broadcasts, the attack structure consists only of the broadcaster and the access structure is any receiver.Natural broadcasts are thus immune to the problem, described in the discussion of the Byzantine Generals problem below, of a transmitter sending different values to different receivers. Indeed, as we will see below, distributed researchers have gone to great lengths just to recreate this simple property on the Internet with logical broadcast protocols.Nature provides clocks that are oblivious to the malicious intentions of any outside parties. In the case of a remote high-energy system such as a pulsar, this means anybody. Pulsars are many orders of magnitude more accurate than random delays that face attackers on the Internet. If critical Internet servers were synchronized to natural clocks in a secure and timely fashion, they would be immune to attacks that relied on uncertainties in timing.More here.Detecting pulsars is still, alas, a difficult process, but not so hard that amateurs have had no success doing so.   Amateurs have had some success tracking pulsars with  software defined radio and quagi antennas combined with digital signal processing.
Modern civics and political science is often taught as an absurd dichotomy: that government is a "monopoly over the use of force" and that the absence of government is anarchy. Using this fallacious dialectic, many highly lawful societies, such as most of medieval Europe, and in particular medieval and renaissance England, were "anarchies." Even the United States is really an "anarchy": jurisdictions are divided up among federal, state, county, municipal and other entities, including shopping malls and mass transit authorities whose security guards can legally arrest probable criminals. (Some states even still allow "citizen arrest," although it's not recommended that people who don't understand the procedural distinctions between arrest and kidnapping try it). Government does not, and should not, come in the abstract forms taught by high school civics and political science, nor as in the economic models of law that talk about law being enforced by "the government."In medieval and renaissance England (and in many later instances), English jurisdictions were property. The king had granted (as property called a "franchise") much jurisdiction to lords and corporate bodies (such as Church organizations, municipalities, and colonies) but owned the residual jurisdiction of the realm (i.e., all jurisdiction not owned by somebody else). This grant would take the form of a property deed called a charter. A franchise could also be owned by prescription -- i.e. by having exercised the jurisdiction since the English "time out of mind" year for prescriptive property rights, 1189 A.D.Where franchise courts had exclusive jurisdiction, the king's courts were merely "night watchmen" courts that insured that the franchise courts stayed within their property boundaries, i.e. their jurisdictional and procedural bounds. Medieval and early colonial English courts thus formed more of a "peer-to-peer" system than the hierarchical current (Roman imperial style, or "sovereign") system where "higher courts" generally review both the procedure and substance of judgments in "lower courts."Franchise jurisdictions were defined, by custom or statute or express charter language, by the people and legal subjects over which jurisdiction could be exercised. For example, a merchant court could exercise jurisdiction over merchants doing business at the market fair the court was appurtenant to, and the law it exercised was merchant law. This only had to be consistent with royal law in keeping within its jurisdiction (procedurally as well as territorially): substantively such laws could and often did diverge sharply from royal substantive law.There were dozens of standard jurisdictional franchises. For example, "infangthief" enabled the franchise owner to hang any thief caught red-handed in the franchise territory, whereas "outfangthief" enabled the owner to chase the thief down outside the franchise territory, catch him red-handed, and then hang him. "Gallows" enabled the owner to try and punish any capital crime, and there were a variety of jurisdictions correponding to several classes of lesser offenses. "View of frankpledge" allowed the owner to control a local militia to enforce the law. "The sheriff's pleas" allowed the owner to hear any case that would normally be heard in a county court. There were also franchises that allowed the collection of various tolls and taxes.A corporation was also a franchise, and corporations often held, as appurtenances, jurisdictional franchises. The City of London was and is a corporate franchise. In the Counties Palatine the entire government was privately held, and most of the American Colonies were corporate franchises that held practically all jurisdiction in their territory, sometimes subject to reservations (such as the common law rights of English subjects and the right of the king to collect customs reserved in the American charters). The colonies could in turn grant franchises to local lords (as with the Courts Baron and Courts Leet in early Maryland) and municipalities. American constitutions are largely descended from such charters.In terms of protecting personal liberties, franchises in general and colonial corporations in particular ranged all over the map. Those where Englishmen themselves settled in large numbers, such as the American colonies, tended to be protective and even expansive of liberties, but many other English colonial corporations, from the East India Company (first chartered in the late 16th century) to the Royal South Africa Company (Cecil Rhodes' colonial corporation, chartered in the late 19th century) could be authoritarian and brutal especially to non-Englishmen.Through medieval and renaissance times, and to some extent well into the colonial period, the basic laws of English jurisdiction were property laws. The basic actions (kinds of lawsuit) contesting the jurisdiction or procedure of a court were those of title and trespass. Infringement of jurisdiction was a trespass, and abuse of a defendant by a court (i.e. violating certain common procedural laws) could be a trespass. If any person, including a royal or franchise official, confiscated a person's goods, or imprisoned an individual, or administered some other coercive remedy, he could be sued for trespass. He then had to defend his use of force as a matter of legal authority -- that he had rights as a victim seeking remedy, or rights by owning a jurisdictional franchise, and that he exercised those rights within the personal, substantive, and procedural bounds of the jurisdiction.The king's courts could only reach inside exclusive franchise jurisdictions through the "extraordinary" or "prerogative" writs, which were writs of trespass or title. Thus, where franchise courts held the substantive jurisdiction, the king's courts generally could not review their proceedings for substantive error: only for trespassing on jurisdiction and committing certain procedural defaults, such as depriving a defendant of a right to jury trial. Indeed, many of the procedural rights specified in today's United States Constitution probably have their origins in the legal authority defense required of both franchise and royal courts to exercise coercive process without trespassing on the defendant.David Friedman has described the legal system of medieval Iceland. This was also a peer-to-peer justice system, albeit less specialized and in some ways even more decentralized, and where personal jurisdiction was tied more to choice than to territory. In political science terms medieval Iceland has been called an "anarchy," but it is more realistic to describe it as a very peer-to-peer kind of government, where medieval England was partly peer-to-peer and partly hierarchical, and modern governments tend, on the imperial Roman model, to be quite hierarchical.The Icelandic system was also based on a jurisdictional property, the godord. However, the godord was more a protection service, champion, legal advocate, and executor of the law than a judge. The court of last resort, since Iceland had no king, was the democratic allthing, but it was more than a night-watchman court as it reviewed substance as well as procedure of dispute settlements arbitrated between godord. In our modern system of arbitration, based on choice-of-forum clauses in contracts, personal jurisdiction is based even more on choice, but it is embedded within our imperial Roman style hierarchical and territorial court system that reviews arbitrations for substance as well as procedure, and arbitrators depend on normal governmental entities to execute their judgments: they have no police powers of their own.At the same time as the American Revolution eliminated most titles, it (on top of the early Parliamentarian revolutions) eliminated most franchises, except for certain rigid forms such as municipal corporations which are no longer considered an instance of a franchise. Corporate colonies and Counties Palatine were converted into States. (Actually this process started well before the American Revolution, which was more of a climax to this process). The modern laws of interstate jurisdiction came to be derived largely from international law rather than from franchise property law, and the procedural rights of defendants were encoded in constitutions which succeeded the colonial charters. Today the word "franchise" is typically reserved to official monopolies such as water utilities and jurisdictional and police powers are defined by statute not property grant. The laws of procedure are now based on constitutions and statutes, and the laws of jurisdiction are generally derived from international law (treating for this purpose States as sovereign states) rather than the old franchise law. However, some of the extraordinary writs, such as habeus corpus, survive in the ability of the U.S. Supreme Court to reach into non-Article III courts (e.g. state courts, military courts, etc.) to review their proceedings, usually still on jurisdictional and procedural grounds.I will have much more to say about the "peer-to-peer plus nightwatchmen" model of "government," and the extraordinary writs, in future post(s). I have also describe the actual English system in much more detail, in a paper to be forthcoming.
There's a strong distinction to be made between "wet code," interpreted by the brain, and "dry code," interpreted by computers. Human-read media is wet code whereas computer code and computer-readable files (to the extent a computer deals meaningfully with them) are "dry code." Law is wet code, interpreted by those on whom the law is imposed, and interpreted (often somewhat differently) by law enforcers, but most authoritatively (and even more differently) interpreted by judges. Human language is mostly wet code but to the extent computer programs crudely translate from one language to another, keyword-ad programs parse text to made an educated guess as to what ads a user will most likely click, and so on, human language text can also be dry code. Traditional contracts are wet code whereas smart contracts are mostly dry code. Secure property titles and the domain name system are mostly dry code.Even "mostly dry code" often has surprisingly soggy portions. Smart contracts, for example, can use dialogs to communicate their nature to the user and to allow the user to at least input some parameters, make menu choices, and the like. These are cognitive channels that translate between wet code and dry code. Similarly, the human-readable name in the domain name system is wet code and trademark law is wet code that applies to domain names. Phishing is an attack against cognitive channels using ambiguous wet code, which is probably why dry code programmers have a hard time coming to grips with it.The syntactic properties of wet and dry code are often very similar -- for example, both human and computer language can usually be parsed by pushdown automata into context-free grammars. But their semantic content is often radically different, and the semantic content of wet code is often simply unintelligible to a computer, for a variety of often mysterious reasons. If we had good enough theories of human semantics we could program such theories into the computer and the computer would then understand like a brain after all. But we don't, in most areas, so we mostly can't program computers to emulate humans. I believe these mysteries are primarily due to the highly evolved nature of the brain contrasted to the recent and thus naive designs of computers, especially with respect to computers' typical lack of good sensors (they're mostly still far more sensory-deprived than Helen Keller, who had a very informative sense of touch) and relative inability to learn from natural and social environments. Their ability to aggregate disparate kinds of information, for example through conceptual metaphor, is also relatively undeveloped.As computers become "smarter" dry code is (very slowly) coming to do more that was formerly only done by wet code. Once it successfully emulates wet code it soon surpasses it in many respects; for example by now dry code can do simple arithmetic billions of times faster than the typical human. As the idea of smart contracts suggests, there are many fruitful analogies to be made from wet code to dry code, but we must keep in mind the radically different semantics, the strengths and weakness of each, and the need for each to interact with the other to solve real problems.I don't think there is a "magic bullet" theory of artificial intelligence that will uncover the semantic mysteries and give computers intelligence in one fell swoop. I don't think that computers will mysteriously "wake up" one day in some magic transition from zombie to qualia. (I basically agree with Daniel Dennett in this respect). Instead, we will continue to chip away at formalizing human intelligence, a few "bits" at a time, and will never reach a "singularity" where all of a sudden we one day way wake up and realize computers have surpassed us. Instead, there will be numerous "micro-runaways" for particular narrow abilities that we learn how to teach computers to do, such as the runaway over the last century or so in the superiority of computers over humans in basic arithmetic. Computers and humans will continue to co-evolve with computers making the faster progress but falling far short of apocalyptic predictions of "Singularity," except to the extent that much of civilization is already a rolling singularity. For example people can't generally predict what's going to happen next in markets or which new startups will succeed in the long run.
Live from my alma mater, Professor Orin Kerr asks why U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has recently taken the gloves off in her dissenting opinions.   They are getting less "collegial" and more blunt.Ginsburg is following in the grand tradition not only of Justice Harry Blackmun (who, as Kerr points out, sharpened his rhetoric and made fairly direct appeals for political attention just before he retired) but of Justice Antonin Scalia.   Scalia's (in)famously ascerbic dissents have long been an object of interest among legal commentators, who have wondered how such rhetoric can do anything but further antagonize his fellow Justices, whom he presumably would rather influence towards his point of view.The answer is that he had a different audience in mind.   His purpose was probably not, as Kerr suggests for Blackmun, to influence elections themselves -- voters don't read Supreme Court opinions.  Scalia's dissents instead played a big role in drawing the attention of conservative insiders to the Court.  They motivated conservative pundits to pay attention to the Court, and conservative pundits got conservative media generally paying attention.   They had the authority of a Justice to back their claims that there were big problems with the Court.  Scalia's dissents have provided a blueprint for what legal doctrines conservatives should support, and which need fixing, a blueprint which cannot be obtained either from typical conservative punditry about abortion etc. or from the liberal legal academia.  Many talented conservatives became involved in finding and promoting high quality judges with the proper Scaliaist beliefs, like now Chief Justice John Roberts.  Highly motivated conservative attention is why talk radio, to the bewilderment of all except conservatives, buried Harriet Myers for insufficient conservative purity.  Instead of two more Justice David Souters -- a seemingly conservative Republican pick who infamously ended up turning out quite liberal opinions -- conservatives as a result have two more solid seats "in the mold of Scalia and Thomas" -- really far more in the mold of the former -- on the Court with Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.  I give Scalia's sharp dissents much of the credit/blame for that.  An effective ideologue does not pull punches.  Ginsburg and Justice John Paul Stevens would be politically wise to folllow Scalia's strategy of direct talk if they wish to influence future Court choices.  They have the best tenure anybody could hope for and they should directly speak their minds.  As for its overall effect, bluntness may make the Court seem less civilized -- hurting its authority in the same way that taking off its robes and dressing in jeans would hurt its authority -- but it increases the amount and diversity of truth that it speaks.   That is a quite welcome thing in these parts.
I have run some Monte Carlo simulations of hypothetical oil prices implied by long-term inflation expectations.  Based on the Hotelling model of a nonrenewable resource, modified to account for inflation expectations, described here, inflation expectations are assumed to contemplate only the next 50 years, with a 1%/year discount rate.  Oil in each year is assumed to be 1% less valuable to producers than in the preceeding year due to considerations of producer's time preferences, substitution, and less than perfectly secure property rights.  Based on a random walk of inflation expectations (in some cases biased upward to show what happens in an era of increasing inflation expectations, in some cases downward to show happier times of declining inflation expectations), this simulation computes the net present value of the sale of a barrel of oil in 50 years based on the expected inflation over those years minus the discount rate of 1%.   Note that these are not predictions I believe will happen, they are all explanations of what has happened or scenarios of what might happen.The most startling and important thing you'll notice in these charts is that oil  prices are an exponential function of long-run inflation expectations.  Put another way, oil prices swing at a rate that is an exponential function of changes in these inflation expectations.   The reason is quite straightforward -- inflation, like an interest rate, compounds.  With inflation the value of oil in the ground nominally grows in value at the rate of inflation, discounted (in this model at 1%) for the factors indicated above.  Thus in this model when inflation expectations are 1% or below, oil trades simply based on supply/demand fundamentals and expectations about these fundamentals, which in this model are assumed constant.   Note that we assumd the discount rate (based on time preferences, substitability, property rights security, etc.) should be higher than 1%, that would only shift the exponential curve to the right, it wouldn't change its shape.Precious metals generally move in the same way as oil in response to changing inflation expectations, but minerals that can be more readily substituted for than oil will probably not as quickly move to extreme prices.  So this model and these simulations are just as useful for precious metals as they are for oil, and are somewhat less useful but still explain most of the price movements of most other minerals.Here is a scenario similar to what we've recently experienced, with a possible further spike due to a small further increase in long-term inflation expectations, with such expectations then subsiding back to near today's value.  The simulation starts out with inflations expectations at 1% (assumed to correspond to $10/barrel oil), then the expectations move to as high as 7.5%, which gives us $330/barrel oil:Here is a more extreme scenario of what might occur during a possible U.S. federal default discussed in my previous post. At these extremes, prices of coal, natural gas, ethanol, and other near-substitutes for oil have to keep up with oil, and even the capital costs of more indirect substitutes (e.g. nuclear and alternative electricity) have to lose some of their stickiness and keep up more with oil, otherwise oil will be substituted for and prices won't reach these extremes.  My model does not properly account for increased substitability as oil prices increase, which is correct over the long run (inflation eventually reaches all goods and services) but incorrect over the shorter run (because oil prices are much less sticky than most other energy prices).  As a result these models probably overstate oil prices at the higher inflation expectation values.  Precious metals don't have the same problem, so hedging against the most extreme possibilities is better done with precious metals than with oil or other commodities.  Let's finish with a cheerier scenario, where oil prices start at $130/barrel (roughly what they recently have been) and then inflation expectations subside.  I consider this scenario and the first scenario about equally likely, and both of these more probable than the extreme second scenario:

These theories are notabout how people in these cultures perceived or thought about their axes andshells and their uses, much less about the interpretations and explanationsgiven in the accounts of travelers and missionaries, and in the ethnographicliterature. These varied widely, both in how the natives themselves interpretedtheir thoughts and actions and how the various observers who recorded these thoughtsand actions further interpreted them. Understanding the thoughts and feelingsof people in such an alien culture is usually extremely difficult at best. Tryingto get in the heads of people from long-extinct cultures is a futile exercise. Ouraccount will rather be about the evolutionary function of these objects andtheir uses, which was typically unconscious, but which we can infer fromarchaeological facts, objective aspects of ethnographic observations, andgeneral evolutionary and economic principles appropriately adapted.  We talk in short in terms of ultimate rather than proximate explanations [14]: what werethe consequences in terms of Darwinian fitness for the non-concrete uses ofcollectibles?Artifacts as Wealth There were awide variety of objects that at one time or another could have served as to agreater or lesser extent as stores and displays of wealth, and to a greater orlesser extent media for the satisfaction of obligations and units of account.(I will describe what I mean by “media of obligation satisfaction” in futureposts; for now it is sufficient to say that it is a generalization of theeconomic idea of “medium of exchange” to include a wide variety of non-exchangetransactions that transfer wealth). Themanufacture and use of shell beads is more than 100,000 years old, and possiblydates to the earliest millennia of homosapiens.  The use of “ritual” blades and pointsmay be even older, predating our species. The general pattern of artifacts ingeneral and collectibles in particular in terms of their abilities to store,display, or transfer wealth can be diagrammed as follows: At the extreme upper left-hand corner is modern money – usedpurely as a medium of exchange and obligation satisfaction, and with highvelocity, typically several transactions per month.  The predominant such media in a culture alsousually becomes its of account. At the opposite (southeast) extreme are purestores of value – seldom if ever alienated, they usually change ownership onlyat death.  At the northeast extreme arepure collectibles – a low-velocity (a few to a few dozen transfers per humanlifetime) medium of obligation satisfaction and exchange, but also a store anddisplay of wealth.  At the southwestextremely are immediate consumables, such as food obtained from foraging incultures that do not preserve or store their food.“Media for the satisfaction of obligations” is ageneralization of the idea from modern monetary theory that money serves as a media ofexchange. The kinds of obligations that might be satisfied over the course of human evolution are far broader and deeper than just exchange, which was probably far from the most important kind of wealth transfer during the Paleolithic. “Unit of account” is anymeasure or count that people in a society used as a general (across multiplesgoods and services) proxy measure of value.As for display of wealth, according to the theory of thisseries this was the main function of ornamentation, and is derivative from thefunction of these objects as stores of wealth. In a future post we will discussmore about what is meant by this terminology.The correlations between media for the satisfaction of obligationsand units of account, and between stores and displays of wealth, largely holdstrue for Paleolithic and Neolithic times when functions were condensed that arenow quite distinct . In more recent times there has been a strong divergencebetween stores of wealth and displays of wealth (e.g. stocks and bonds vs.jewelry).Most of the durable artifacts that archaeologists dig upfrom the Paleolithic through Bronze Ages, including the early civilizations ofMesopotamia, lived a mixed life – they were concretely useful objects andlow-velocity media of fitness-benefiting transactions and stores anddisplays of wealth, to varying degrees, but seldom if ever used as just any oneof these. They condensed multiplefunctions that we now consider separate and often unrelated, as discussedfurther below.It is important to keep in mind two very large selectionbiases at work in archaeology.  The firstis that apart from some exceptional environments (e.g. peat bogs) that preserveorganic material, only durable objects survive to be dug up by thearchaeologist.  This means that anartifact is more likely to be a collectible than the typical artifact in theculture (which quite preponderantly would have been organic materials forconcrete use that have not survived). The second selection bias is that nearlyall collectors and museums, and most archaeologists, are heavily biased towardscollecting objects that more resemble unique artworks than they are interestedin collecting or studying repetitive and boring objects.  Overcoming this bias can result insubstantial breakthroughs in understanding a culture. For example Denise Schmidt-Besserant discovered the origins of writing in Mesopotamia by focusing on repetitive and unartful claytokens that had been ignored by collectors and ther archaeologists. In addition to the two general selection effects above,another selection effect particularly impacts metals.  That is that metals, especially preciousmetals but even baser metals such as copper and bronze, were recycled veryefficiently. Metallic artifacts we find in archaeological digs are likely to beparticularly unrepresentative of the metallic artifacts most commonly used in asociety.  For money in particular, unlessthey were unique artworks of particular attraction to collectors, an earlier form ofmetallic money has with very high probability been recycled into a later formof metallic money, or into some other metal object, the result being that theearlier forms are highly underrepresented in the archaeological record.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}                                                From the Gutenberg 42-line Bible [source].Some Basic Patternsof CollectiblesThree of the most important patterns of collectibles thathave been discovered in this research are condensation,authority resemblance, and unforgeablecostliness. In the former two cases these patterns are broadly applicableto artifacts in general. Taking these in turn:1. Condensation -- generallyspeaking, the farther back we go intime, the lesser the degree of specialization (division of labor) and thusdifferentiation of technology exists. Furthermore, the weight and bulk ofartifacts per family was much lower in Neolithic society, with its much highertransport costs, than today. In Paleolithic forager societies, which weretypically mobile, belongings had to be carried on the person, resulting in astill radically lower weight or volume of goods controlled by a person or clan.This results as we go back in time in condensation:a given object tends to serve a greater variety of functions: it condenses the functions we consider ortake for granted today as separate and often unrelated functions.  Obtaining fitness benefits by thewidest variety of available means within a society with a radically smallerdivision of labor and differentiation of technology. Thus institutions usuallycondensed the functions of religion with business, business with politics andwar, law with lore, tort law with criminal law, ceremony with accounting, andgang warfare with a substantial body of customary rules. Objects could condensethe functions of jewelry with coinage, and concrete utility with media ofobligation satisfaction and store of value.From our point of view functions in earlier periods areincreasingly condensed, and in Neolithic times were very highly condensed, andin Paleolithic times were radically condensed: a typical object tended to servemany more purposes in the early Paleolithic than in the late Paleolithic, lessstill in the Neolithic, and less still after the dawn of state-likeagricultural societies. Contrariwise the general trend of economic developmentover millennia, and between stages of the Paleolithic and Neolithic, is differentiation.  Missionaries,travellers, and ethnographic observers, as well as their readers, oftencommitted the fallacy of exclusion – concluding that because anobject was used for one thing, that it was not used for another thing in whatwe consider to be a separate sphere of activity.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}Detail from the Giant Bible of Mainz, handwritten in the traditional way around the same time as Gutenberg produced thefirst printed Bible.

Authority resemblance– Initial forms of innovative artifacts, of a kind the value of which was basedat least in part on their authority, often borrowed authority from what theywere replacing by physical resemblance. Mimicry of or semblance to pre-existingauthoritative forms in a new medium was and is a very common feature ofinnovations: examples range from Gutenberg’s printing press mimicking scribalscript to the private overnight parcel service Federal Express alludingby name and color scheme to the United States Postal Service.  The ritualistic airstrips, offices, military drills, etc. of cargo cults were an extreme example ofauthority resemblance, and it predominates in the design of  national flags and many other symbols (suchas commercial brands) that invoke reputation or authority. Where not tabooed orbanned as counterfeiting or trademark violation, authority resemblance was andis a common feature of innovative collectibles, their form invoking a traditional authoratative form while pioneering a new media.The histories of art and architecture in religion, politics,finance, and business are replete with examples of authority resemblance.  The designs of many of the veryearliest coins, which differ greatly from the standard and presumably optimal form they soon converged on and have retained ever since, highlights what existing objects they were inspired by and suggests a similarity in intended role and function between the novel object and the old object whose form it has taken on. We will see in this and future posts that the earliest coins borrowed their form from shells, beads, and themetal blades of tools. <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:Times; panose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p {mso-style-priority:99; mso-margin-top-alt:auto; margin-right:0in; mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; margin-left:0in; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Times; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}Detail of necklace from a burial at Sungir, Russia, 28,000 BP.Interlocking and interchangeable beads.

But withcollectibles, people went out of their way to choose costly goods and undertakecostly methods of manufacture – collectibles such as beads typically had anextremely poor symbol efficiency compared to the available alternatives.  They must have had functions that were much more than symbolic, leading to competingrequirements that we must elucidate.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}Efficient symbolic communication – alreadyexisting and otherwise useful flint painted with symbols (c. 5000 BC) [Source] <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;} As we will see below, beads of shell, bone, and similarobjects were made, strung, and worn for tens of millennia in the vast majorityof Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic cultures. Gratuitous use of costly beads over tens of millennia would have beenweeded out by Darwinian genetic selection. Beads, used as actually observed eitherin Epipaleolithic or Neolithic burials or as observed in the few recentlyobserved such cultures, are not, in contrast to spoken human language and every other information-rich symbolic system, used in any way remotely approaching theefficient coding scheme that would have emerged from natural selection if puresymbolism were their main evolutionary function.  Beads that are arranged in a pleasing regularpattern, as they typically are, carry very little information – they areextremely inefficient in terms of information per unit of weight or volume andespecially per cost of collection and manufacture. Since forager bands weretypically mobile they had even more compelling evolutionary pressure to improvethe symbol efficiency of their media, by evolving choices and designs for the mostefficient available such media, if such recorded communication was anevolutionary important (and evolutionarily accessible) problem. Instead, vocalcommunications were far more useful for mobile forager bands and underwent theradical and unique evolution of human spoken language, while remains of recordedsymbolic communications are sparse and rare.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}Efficient communication –painted pebbles (Norwegian Mesolithic, c. 11,000 BP) <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1; Not only were beads of multiple varieties almost alwaysstrung together in regular patterns that did not take advantage of the codingcapabilities of the multiple varieties, but the most common bead pattern wasrepeating the same kind of bead over and over again, which carries noinformation whatsoever in the arrangement of the beads.

An example of how beads werefar too costly for purely symbolic communications is provided by the costanalysis done on beads found in the Sungir Burials of the 29,000-15,000 BPepoch. Randall White estimates that an individual bead took one to two hours ofwork, and as a result that the grave goods in such a burial represented nearly10,000 hours of labor.

So while beads could have been and sometimes were used forsymbolic purposes, this could not have been their primary evolutionary function– symbolic aspects of their use would have been very secondary. A similaranalysis applies to most other kinds of collectibles, such as “ceremonial”blades and points (most commonly axes). Unforgeable costliness – the securesupply curve of these objects relative to the much more common objects in theenvironment that were not used as collectibles – strongly suggests that thesecollectibles had some function very important to Darwinian fitness related towealth. What that function was has been explored in [1] which I hope toelaborate on in future post(s).<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}Regular pattern of costly beads.

Thus the commonality of authority resemblance in the designof paper money, coins, and jewelry, repeated tropes such as gold foil andexpensive ultramarine blue pigments in medieval and Renaissance European art,etc. But it is the ability of the medium to serve as a secure store and displayof wealth that is doing the heavy lifting here, not its ability to efficientlyconvey information.When costliness becomes insecure, and authority resemblancecomes to predominate over genuine scarcity, we can get counterfeiting crisesthat disrupt the culture relying on the old form of collectible.  The first craftsmen to pound copper and goldflat and apply it to surfaces could make far more surface look lavish than waspossible with solid copper or gold. Such a counterfeiting crisis would haveproduced a kind of inflation broader than monetary inflation: a change inexpectations about wealth securely displayed as well as wealth securely storedin an object. To the extent imitation cowrie shells (see below) could be madeout of materials much cheaper than the genuine cowrie (e.g. stone) it couldproduce such inflation. Trade beads were colonial examples: mass-producedbeads that were supernormal models of shell beads shiny from wear, usurpingtheir authority, while being cheaply mass produced, undermining the previouslyunforgeable costliness of beads.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:Times;

"Shelling Out: The Origins of Money" argued, and future posts will argue, that [C]ollectiblesprovided a fundamental improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism,allowing humans to cooperate in ways unavailable to other species. For them,reciprocal altruism is severely limited by unreliable memory. Some otherspecies have large brains, build their own homes, or make and use tools. Noother species has produced such an improvement to the workings of reciprocalaltruism. [Economist Karl]Menger called this first money an "intermediate commodity" -- whatthis paper calls collectibles. An artifact useful for other things, such ascutting, could also be used as a collectible. However, once institutionsinvolving wealth transfer became valuable, collectibles would be manufacturedjust for their collectible properties. What are these properties? For aparticular commodity to be chosen as a valuable collectible, it would have had,relative to products less valuable as collectibles, at least the followingdesirable qualities: (1)   More secure from accidental loss and theft.  For most of history this meant it could becarried on the person and easy to hide.    (2)   Harder to forge its value.  Animportant subset of these are products that are unforgeably costly, and thereforeconsidered valuable…(3)   This value was more accurately approximated by simple observations ormeasurements. These observations would have had more reliable integrity yethave been less expensive. Humansacross the world are strongly motivated to collect items that better satisfythese properties. Some of this motivation probably includes genetically evolvedinstincts. Such objects are collected for the sheer pleasure of collecting them(not for any particularly good explicit and proximate reasons), and suchpleasure is nearly universal across human cultures. One of the immediateproximate motivations is decoration. According to Dr. Mary C. Stiner, anarchaeologist at the University of Arizona, "Ornamentation is universalamong all modern human foragers." [W02] For an evolutionary psychologist,such a behavior that has a good ultimate explanation, in terms of naturalselection, but has no proximate rationale other than pleasure, is a primecandidate to be a genetically evolved pleasure that motivates the behavior.Such is, if the reasoning in this essay is correct, the human instinct tocollect rare items, art, and especially jewelry. <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}“Miniature Bi disc”,jade, from the late Neolithic to Bronze Ages, c. 3000-2000 BCE, diameter1.25" to 2” [Source]<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:Times; panose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p {mso-style-priority:99; mso-margin-top-alt:auto; margin-right:0in; mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; margin-left:0in; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Times; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}Thekind of mobile art made by Paleolithic humans, (small figurines and thelike) also matches these characteristics well. Indeed, Paleolithic peoples madevery few objects that were not either utilitarian, or shared characteristics(1)-(3). There are many puzzling instances of useless or at least unused flintswith homo sapiens…Cunliffe [C94] discusses a European Mesolithic erafind of hundreds of flints, carefully crafted, but which micrograph analysisreveals were never used for cutting. Flintswere quite likely the first collectibles, preceding special-purposecollectibles like jewelry. Indeed, the first flint collectibles would have beenmade for their cutting utility. Their added value as a medium of wealthtransfer was a fortuitous side effect that enabled the institutions describedin this article to blossom. These institutions, in turn, would have motivatedthe manufacture of special-purpose collectibles, at first flints that need haveno actual use as cutting tools, then the wide variety of other kinds ofcollectibles that were developed by homo sapiens.  It is no coincidencethat the attributes of collectibles are shared with precious metals, coins, andthe reserve commodities that have backed most non-fiat currencies. Money properimplemented these properties a purer form than the collectibles used duringalmost all of human prehistory. <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:Times; panose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;

Theapproach to the coast there is quite steep. As a result, even though the cavesare still above sea level today, and were thus 60-80 meters above sea level inthe Upper Paleolithic, they lie a short (but steep) walk of probably around 1kilometer from that era’s shoreline.The inhabitants of these caves lived in a climate that wasmore like that of today’s Baltic Sea region than of today’s Mediterranean.  They feasted both on land animals such asdeer and on marine resources, a mix that trended from land resources to a mixof land and marine resources over the period recorded in the archaeologicallayers. These people walked the shore not just in search of food, but also insearch of a very specific set of uncommon yet authoritative objects – shells ofthe sea snail Nassarius gibbosulus. Oncecollected they were selected for size and intactness, and laboriouslyperforated.  They were then strung onto cords,presumably as necklaces, bracelets, or belts, or sewn onto clothes, as beadswould appear in later Paleolithic burials. Extensive cord-wear exists on most of the beads.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:Times;

According toStiner et. al.:Something about the basket-shaped forms in particular– their resemblance to something else or just their geometry – held theinterests of people over very long stretches of time. It is difficult to arguethat continuity in species and forms across such vast stretches of time andspace reflects cultural affinity or continuity, particularly in the case ofbeautiful natural objects. Whilepreferred shell forms stayed much the same, other aspects of culture varied agreat deal.[6]<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p.MsoListParagraph, li.MsoListParagraph, div.MsoListParagraph {mso-style-priority:34; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.5in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-add-space:auto; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p.MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst, li.MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst, div.MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst {mso-style-priority:34; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-type:export-only; margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.5in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-add-space:auto; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p.MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle, li.MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle, div.MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle {mso-style-priority:34; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-type:export-only; margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.5in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-add-space:auto; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p.MsoListParagraphCxSpLast, li.MsoListParagraphCxSpLast, div.MsoListParagraphCxSpLast {mso-style-priority:34; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-type:export-only; margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.5in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-add-space:auto; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}Severe conservatismof shells selected for use as beads at Üçağızlifromc. 41,000 BP (layer I) to 29,000 BP (layer EPI) – time goes from bottom to top.Relative frequencies of Columbella, Nassarius, Dentalium, Gibbula, and othertaxa used as shell beads.  There was duringthis long period a very strong preference for the “basket-shaped” shells of themost typical size of Columbella and Nassarius over the many other and morecommon shapes and sizes of shells across the Mediterranean.

They must be common and consistent enough tofind or make a sufficient number of fungible instances to allow divisibility,and2. They must be rare enough or costly enough to maketo constitute substantial wealth with low bulk and weight, and must fit snuglyenough together when strung and worn, that they do not overburden the mobileforgers who carry them around when changing campsites (as they often did).These hard-to-find shells of Nassarius and Columbella were the objects in the Mediterraneanforager environments that best satisfied these criteria.  Incorporating as they did unforgeablecostliness, they would have also made splendid stores and displays ofwealth.  In any of these roles, they werea pure collectible.

But even one light-sensing cell can be useful in telling thedifference between night and day, which in some environments can be stronglycorrelated with the availability of food or protection from predators.

But two types were widely spread intime and space: beads of shell or bone were ubiquitous in Paleolithic andNeolithic cultures, while “ornamental” blades and points were widely popular inthe Neolithic and possibly much further back in time.In both cases where coins were invented – along the coast ofTurkey and in parts of China – many early coins resembled shell beads inprobable cases of authority resemblance. Prior to the invention of coinage manymetal beads had also been shaped in forms resembling shell beads. Before thewidespread use of coinage, the artifacts we now see as jewelry likely alsooften condensed a function similar to early coinage.

Contraryto a currently popular archaeological theory, the main use of these shell beadswas not as “information technology” or the visual convenience of symbolicinformation via different combinations of shell beads. Other materialsavailable in forager environments and other techniques foragers could use weremuch better suited to cost-efficient symbolic communications. Instead whatcoins and jewelry, at least as far back as the very conservative shell beadtraditions of the Upper Paleolithic, have in common, in sharp contrast tocost-efficient symbolic systems, is unforgeable costliness, which securelyconstrained the supply curve of these goods. This economic security feature strongly suggests functions related towealth and the fitness benefits of wealth.

Last week the default risk on U.S. Treasury bonds doubled.  This week it has increased still more.  This risk is measured by credit default swaps (CDS's), which insure investors against bond defaults.  Of course this risk, contrary to a very stupid but very popular myth among U.S. economists, has never has been zero: there is no such thing as a "risk-free" investment.  Anybody with a modicum of knowledge of economic history knows (in other words, alas, very few people know) that over historical timeframes government defaults on their debt, both overt and covert (through inflation), are common.  Indeed over >20 year timeframes even stocks are less risky than government bonds, but for shorter timeframes bonds are, in nominal terms at least, normally far less volatile than stocks.  Reuters observed,The cost to insure Treasury debt with credit default swaps jumped to 16.5 basis points, or $16,500 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, from 8 basis points on Thursday, an analyst said....Debt protection costs on U.S. government debt are now higher than those for Germany, which trades at 9.5 basis points, and are trading at similar levels as Japan and the United Kingdom, which are around 16.5 basis points, the analyst said.So far this week it has increased to 22 basis points for five years of default insurance. Bloomberg observes the probable cause of this increased risk:Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said July 13 the U.S. would seek authority from Congress to buy unlimited equity in so-called government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to extend them as much credit as needed. The move effectively put the weight of the treasury behind the companies, which own or guarantee almost half of the $12 trillion in U.S. home loans outstanding. The Federal Reserve also agreed to lend directly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In other words, not only is the Federal Reserve now playing John Law by printing dollars to buy bad real estate investments, but now the federal government has declared its willingness to get in on the act in an even bigger way.Note that default risks measured by CDS's do not include the risks of what are effectively ongoing de facto mini-defaults on all dollar-denominated debt due to inflation, risks that have been rising substantially over the past ten years, as reflected by the prices of the main insurance against inflation risk, commodities.In the U.S. there have been a number of de facto inflationary defaults on U.S. federal debt -- the Revolutionary War (Continentals), Civil War (Greenbacks), Great Depression (resetting the gold conversion rate).  The largest de facto default occured in the 1970s (float and inflation) and we are in the midst of one currently (float and inflation) that may turn out to be even larger.  But the only overt default on "national" governmental debt in our 232-year history was that of the Confederate States of America in the throes of losing its war against the (rest of the) U.S.   Compared to the 1970s, oil is responding faster and more completely to Fed inflation, and oil remains a crucial part of our industries.  As a result, the havoc caused by high oil prices may put a stronger limit this time on how quickly the Fed shredder can dispose of the real value of U.S. paper.  If the degree covert default is thus limited, but the risk of default increases, the risk of overt default rises.   The market last week seemed to be saying that the Fed may be starting to approach some such limit, perhaps a political limit due to hysteria over gas and food prices, on its practical ability to inflate the U.S. currency.  In other words, markets may be saying the Fed cannot necessary resort to a Weimar- or Zimbabwe-style hyperinflation -- that if federal financing gets to that extreme U.S. politicians may choose to overtly default instead.   The city of Vacaville, California recently overtly defaulted on its debt, as have a number of other municipalities in the U.S.  Worldwide overt defaults on government debt during the second half of the 20th century usually occured in Third and Second World governments (e.g. Russia in the 1990s), but there were a large number of overt government defaults in governments of all sorts early in the Great Depression (indeed these were a leading cause of that economic disaster), and in prior centuries government defaults wherever governments borrowed money, including leading nations in Western Europe, were common.  Mature democracies with central banks that can engage in covert defaults (inflation) have had a far lower rate of overt defaults than other forms of government or democracies without central banks.That the risk of overt default has now substantially increased means that investors are are recognizing that the unprecedented revenue-generating combination created in 1913 -- IRS (which has been able to reliably collect $trillions per year) and the Federal Reserve (which has been reliably able to enage in covert gradual defaults by printing money to buy $trillions worth of Treasury debt per year) -- is not indestructible.  U.S. Treasuries, like every other investment, have never been risk-free and they've just gotten quite a bit riskier.  Nevertheless compared to historical averages for governments, the risk of overt default by that powerhouse 1913 duo is pretty low.   With very high probability they will keep paying interest and principal on their debt while me and my fellow U.S. taxpayers will keep having to shell out substantial sums to the IRS every year, and see our dollars frittered away every year, that this dynamic duo may continue to uphold "the good faith and credit of the United States" while the discreditable activities, often done in rather poor faith, of the federal government in "redistributing" wealth, attacking foreign countries in very expensive ways, promising vast pensions that it cannot pay, promising health care that it cannot fund, and forcing private businesses to do bizarre things (like take on vast amounts of moral hazard by lending into "underserved communities", and to actually fund those government medical mandates) continues.In related financial news, what I've been predicting for a long time would happen is starting to happen: the U.S. dollar inflation indices PPI and CPI, despite being under-reported compared to prior decades (due to a radical revision of the formulae), are starting to rise to 1970s rates of increase.  Sticky prices in manufactured goods and services, as well as wages (the stickiest prices of all), are playing a very long-term game of catch-up to commodity prices, and especially to gold and oil, which are leading indicators of inflation.  I continue to predict 5%-15%/year increases in the CPI and PPI, and probable "stagflation" (inflation plus recession, which according to Keynesians is not supposed to happen), until such time as they catch up to the commodity price increases.  Commodity prices themselves, despite their stratospheric levels, may continue to increase as the Federal Reserve tries to deal with large government deficits and the fallout from the awful moral hazard in our housing markets, a moral hazard in no small part due to previous inflationary policy by the Fed itself combined with the outrageous pressures from U.S. politicians to relax lending standards in order to get people to buy houses in "under-served communities" and naive "real estate always goes up" bubble behavior on the part of the real estate industry and house buyers.  The Fed-and-IRS-backed political franchises Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have been moral hazard disasters waiting to happen.   Inflation is still by far the largest problem these federal activities are causing; the doubling of the overt default risk is just an interesting related blip.  My recommendation: keep only spending money, not savings or long-term investments, in dollars or dollar-denominated debt, and keep trying to unstick your own wages by frequently asking your boss for a big raise.On the increase in Treasury default risk  H/T to Alex Tabarrok.
Over a hundreds years ago, John Stuart Mill had this vision of a world of school vouchers instead of the government-dictated curriculum that is the current dominant model of public education.  Government-dictated curriculum features listening and speech compelled by a command-and-control hierarchy.  Control over this curriculum is the source of endless conflict between irreconcilable opinions.  Government-compelled speech and listening flies in the face of freedom of expression in a marketplace of ideas that is the hallmark of a free society.   Mill proposed an actual marketplace for schools.  The Institute for Justice is leading the legal effort to implement this marketplace of ideas for parents and their children in the United States.
In what ways does your vote count?  Should you vote for the candidate you most agree with or for the least objectionable candidate who can win?  I can't put it any better than this comment by Mark Bahner, which deserves its own blog post:...I don't think my one vote can't change the course of a presidential election, I know it can't, to greater than 99.99+ percent certainty.So why vote? For the same reason that some people (I admit I'm not one of them) agree to respond to Nielson TV-watching polls.It's a poll. And for the president, your one vote can't possibly change who gets elected. (This is in contrast to local politics, in which a school bond in my parents town actually finished with a tie, with some 10,000+ votes cast.)That's why it makes sense (if you're going to vote at all) to vote for the presidential candidate who is closest to your political views. If you are a libertarian, there is only one libertarian running in either party. That's Ron Paul. Mitt Romney is not even in the same league, stadium, or country as Ron Paul, as a libertarian. Ron Paul is a libertarian. Mitt Romney is not. And neither is any other other Democratic and Republican candidate. The main thing you do with a vote is send a signal to political players about your views.  The second thing you do with a vote is create a power bloc with which other candidates may have to negotiate and compromise.   Very far down on the list of things your vote might be good for is changing who wins.   Only for this last inconsequential reason to vote is the "they can't win" argument relevant.   If you are not voting for the candidate you most agree with, regardless of their chances of winning, you truly are throwing away your vote.
Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial is the only major memorial in the United States capitol showing the names of the deceased. The other major memorials in D.C. are paeans to the politicans who put soldiers and civilians in the path of death and destruction or to the environments where the destruction took place. For example, the World War II Memorial echoes concrete bunkers and gun batteries. In contrast the Vietnam Memorial is an interactive experience where loved ones can come and remember those who actually sacrificed by leaving pictures, flowers, or flags and taking rubbings of their loved one's name.
The current debate over statutory restrictions on the uses of the writ of habeas corpus should lead us to re-examine the foundations and context of that prerogative writ. The only explicit mention of it in the U.S. Constitution is in Art. I Sec. 9, as one of the restrictions on the powers of Congress:"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not  be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety  may require it."From this language we may reasonable conclude two important principles:Habeas corpus may only be suspended by an act of Congress (which raises the question of what is to be done if Congress and the courts cannot convene).Habeas corpus is presumed to be a right that precedes the Constitution and is incorporated by it, by restriction on when it may be suspended.But if the writ of habeas corpus precedes the Constitution and is incorporated into it, does that make it one of the unenumerated rights of the Ninth Amendment, and if so, what about the other prerogative writs that have a similar status in common law, such as quo warranto, mandamus, prohibito, procedendo, and certiorari? We don't hear much about these in current jurisprudence, except the last, in discretionary appeals.I have argued in a paper in progress, "Presumption of Nonauthority and Unenumerated Rights", at http://www.constitution.org/9ll/schol/pnur.htm , that all of those writs, and more, are indeed among the unenumerated rights of the Ninth Amendment, and that, contrary to current doctrine, these are not creatures of statute but fundamental rights that may not be constitutionally burdened. For evidence of this we can find among the proposed amendments from the New York ratifying convention not just a declaration of the writs as rights, but of a right to petition for the rights "in the name of the people", that is, as private attorneys general. That we have the rights was taken for granted. Only the standing of any person to petition for them was thought necessary to be asserted in an amendment.Habeas corpus can be considered a subset of quo warranto. The former demands an official prove his authority to detain a person, but the latter demands an official, including a private official, prove his authority to do anything he may be doing or threatening to do, including holding an office. The former requires the official to produce the detainee in court. The latter requires him to suspend his activity until proof is made.Was there ever a time, following the Declaration of Independence, which made the people the sovereign, when any individual could go to court with a petition for a writ of quo warranto and get an official activity suspended until that official proved his authority? Yes, there was, in the early republic, but so seriously did officials take the threat of such a writ that they took great care not to exceed their authority, so that the remedy almost never had to be carried forward, or precedents established. It should come as no surprise that officials don't like the right and have done almost everything they can to deny or deprecate it or make people forget about it.Perhaps it's time to change that.Most law schools don't teach much about the prerogative writs, not even habeas corpus. It should come as no surprise that many lawyers and judges are unclear on the concept or how it is supposed to work, if we followed the original standard of due oprocess. Too many judges treat a petition as an ex parte motion to show cause, with the burden on the petitioner. It is not. The writ is not an order from the court to produce the prisoner and the proof. The petition itself is the order to do that, much like a citation in a civil case, to respond to the filed petition. the writ is the finding by the court of whether the official has the authority, ordering release of the prisoner if he does not.The only statutory component of habeas corpus, or the other writs, was a prescription of how much time the official has to comply. Originally, that ranged from three to twenty days, depending on the distance of the official from the court.The question may arise, what happens if the court fails or refuses to hold a hearing, or accepts the authority of the official without the proof? This question is critical to an understanding of the role of courts in the Anglo-American legal tradition. The answer, by original standards of due process, is that the writ issues by default if the respondant fails to respond, or even if the court fails to hold a hearing. If the judge accepts the official's claim of authority without proof, then by those ancient standards, the judge himself may be removed from his position by a writ of quo warranto. In 18th century England this became a serious matter, and "peasants with torches and pitchforks" burning down courthouses and hanging judges was something that actually happened. If courts were derelict the people, as militia, took the law into their own hands, enforcing writs that by common understanding issued by default. But that process was not always so "due", and the line between militia enforcing the law and an enraged mob was often crossed.We now live in an era of increasing tension between the judiciary and the public. This is a matter that deserves our constructive attention, or history could repeat itself.
Chief Justice Roberts has denied RIM's request to stay an injunction by the trial court that might soon shut down RIM's Blackberry e-mail system, which has been held to violate NTP's United States wireless e-mail patent.   The Supreme Court is still considering RIM's petition for writ of certiorari (i.e. whether to take the case on appeal).  The Federal Circuit held that RIM's distributed system in North America, with a relay server located in Canada and some of the Blackberries and their users located in the United States, violated NTP's United States patent for a distributed e-mail system involving wireless devices and a relay.
Here's my own tentative proposal (besides my variations on Buchanan's proposals).  It may be even more important and interesting than Buchanan's (as important as those are); why is left as an exercise for the reader.  I call it the Jurisdictional Choice Amendment."No law shall infringe an arbitration clause in a contract, nor shall original jurisdiction of said arbitrator over any area of civil law of the United States or any unit of government therein specified in said clause be denied.  The courts of the United States and of any unit of government therein shall defer to the findings of fact of said arbitrator unless clearly erroneous."
Robin Hanson asks, "what key features make this [human] growth groove possible?" -- two key events being the birth of agriculture and the industrial revolution.  Commenter "gwern" is on the money in saying that (a) explaining why the IR happened when and where it did is hard, and (b) the explanation has to include something that China didn't have much sooner, which eliminates most of the usual explanations.  I'd add that explaning the birth of agriculture is even harder -- we have vast amounts of historical data on the IR and only archaeological and comparative anthropological evidence about the birth of agriculture.Indeed, the most important thing in explaing these two events is to be aware of enough facts from different fields, and have sufficient doses of skepticism and common sense, that you can eliminate the many theories that are popular but obviously, if you know enough such things, wrong.  For example, be aware that hunter-gatherers were experts on botany and animal behavior. It's not plausible that the simple ideas that seeds can grow into plants that you can eat later, or that you can keep an animal tied or penned up and eat it later, were not discovered and known countless times during the c. 100,000 years between when our brains became modern-sized and agriculture developed. There has to have been some major barrier to benefitting from such obvious ideas to have kept agriculture from developing far sooner. I also don't find genetics plausible as a cause of agriculture, since agriculture ended up spreading to a number of human groups that had become genetically isolated long before the dawn of agriculture. (Genetic evolution caused by agriculture is another story -- Cochran and Harpending have some ideas very much worth thinking about). Also not plausible are climate explanations -- there were many local climates hospitable to agriculture throughout those 100,000 years -- just not necessarily at Mediterranean or higher lattitudes.That said, going back to the IR there a number of likely-to-firm differences between China and Western Europe (or Great Britain in particular):(1) Differences in political and legal culture. What differences, specifically, it's hard to say, because there is very little about, for example, Sung or Ming dynasty commercial law that has been translated into English: far too little to compare to English law in the 18th century, for example. We know some very general things, such as that Western Europe was (and still is) a far more legalistic culture than China. Also, we know that Western Europe (contrary to Gregory Clark's claim) radically changed its property law between the 16th and 19th centuries, from a feudal model of of hierarchy of tenures and bundled political property rights to a model based on old Roman law with flattened and purely economic ownership. There ensued movements such as the enclosure movement in England and an accompanying large increase in capital investments in land. But we don't know when or to what extent similar incentives to capital investment might have been present or missing in China.(2) China never controlled the world's oceans and merchant marine, but the British just prior and during its IR did. If this explains the IR, then to explain our explanation (i.e. why did Britain come to control the world's ocean-going trade) we have to step back and solve the even more puzzling question of how a tiny country of fishing-folk and small-time crusaders, Portugal, and not an advanced superpower like China, was the first country to take over most of the world's oceanic trade routes (later to be beaten back by other Western European countries and eventually Great Britain).(3) China had the printing press, but in contrast to Western Europe it did not lead to a rapid growth in literacy sustained over several centuries -- perhaps because of bureaucratic central control rather than the free-enterprise printing businesses that sprung up all over Western Europe, perhaps because the much greater number of symbols did not as efficiently lend itself to printing as the Roman alphabet, or a combination of these two factors.(The Romans were not all good -- indeed they gave our culture something quite nasty which I will blog on in the near future).Other interesting related phenomenon to explain, (and it would be nice per Occam's Razor if it was the same general explanation, but social life is rarely that simple) is why Japan industrialized well in advance of China and Britain was a few decades ahead of the rest of Western Europe during most of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century.Robin: "If you wanted to attribute the industrial revolution to writing, you'd have to explain why there was a strong threshold effect, so that pre-1800 writing levels had weak growth rate effects, while post-1800 writing levels had strong effects."Besides threshold effects, there could be delay effects: for example, the the rapid growth of books and literacy after the mid-15th century in Western Europe gave rise to a slow but accelerating series of innovations (most obviously scientific and technological advances, but perhaps also innovations in business or law), which in turn gave rise to the IR.

This is the first in a series of articles about mining the sea floor for minerals. This article is about the first and largest such activity, offshore oil and gas, and especially the more recent activity in deep water oil. First, however, there is currently a fasionable topic, the discussion of which will help put deep water oil in perspective: namely the nonsense about "peak oil" -- the theory that worldwide oil production has or will soon peak and that we thus inevitably face a future of higher oil prices.Layout of the Total Girassol field, off the shore of Angola in 1,400 meters of water, showing the FPSO ship, risers, flow lines, and subsea trees (well caps and valves on the sea floor).Why peak oil is nonsenseThere are any number of reasons why peak oil is nonsense, such as tar sands and coal gasification. Perhaps the most overlooked, however, is that up until now oil companies have focused on land and shallow seas, which are relatively easy to explore. But there is no reason to expect that oil, which was largely produced by oceans in the first place (especially by the precipitation of dead plankton), is any more scarce underneath our eon's oceans as it is under our lands. Oceans cover over two-thirds of our planet's surface, and most of that is deep water (defined in this series as ocean floor 1,000 meters or more below the surface). A very large fraction of the oil on our planet remains to be discovered in deep water. Given a reasonable property rights regime enforced by major developed world powers, this (along with the vast tar sands in Canada) means not only copious future oil, but that this oil can mostly come from politically stable areas.The FPSO, riser towers and flow lines in Total's Girassol field off of Angola. Some perspective, even some purely theoretical perspective, is in order. If we look at the problem at the scale of the solar system, we find that hydrocarbons are remarkably common -- Titan has clouds and lakes of ethane and methane, for example, and there are trillions of tonnes of hydrocarbons, at least, to be found on comets and in the atmospheres and moons of the gas giant planets. What is far more scarce in the solar system is free oxygen. If there will ever be a "peak" in the inputs to hydrocarbon combustion in the solar system it will be in free oxygen -- which as a natural occurence is extremely rare beyond Earth's atmosphere, and is rather expensive to make artificially.  A deep sea "robot hand" on a ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) more often than not ends in an attachment specific for the job. Here, a subsea hydraulic grinder and a wire brush. What's even more scarce, however, are habitable planets that keep a proper balance between greenhouse gases and sunlight. Venus had a runaway greenhouse, partly from being closer to the sun and partly because of increased carbon dioxide in its atmosphere which acts like an inulating blanket, preventing heat from radiating away quickly enough. The result is that Venus' surface temperature is over 400 C (that's over 750 fahrenheit), hotter than the surface of Mercury. On Mars most of its atmosphere escaped, due to its low gravity, and its water, and eventually even much of its remaining carbon dioxide, froze, again partly due the greater distance from the sun and partly due the low level of greenhouse gases in its generally thin atmosphere. Hydraulic subsea bandsaw. Great for cutting pipes as shown here. So far, the Earth has been "just right", but the currently rapidly rising amount of carbon dioxide and methane in our atmosphere, largely from the hydrocarbons industries, is moving our planet in the direction of Venus. Nothing as extreme as Venus is in our foreseeable future, but neither will becoming even a little bit more like Venus be very pleasant for most of us. The real barrier to maintaining our hydrocarbon-powered economy is thus not "peak oil", but emissions of carbon dioxide and methane with the resulting global warming. That peak oil is nonsense makes global warming even more important problem to solve, at least in the long term. We won't avoid it by oil naturally becoming too expensive; instead we must realize that our atmosphere is a scarce resource and make property out of it, as we did with "acid rain."This series isn't mainly about oil or the atmosphere, however; it is about the technology (and perhaps some of the politics and law) about extracting minerals generally from the deep sea. Oil is the first deep sea mineral to be extracted from the sea on a large scale. The rest of this article fill look at some of the technology used to recover offshore oil, especially in deep water. Future posts in this series will look at mining other minerals off the ocean floor. Painting of the deepwater (1,350 meters) subsea trees at the Total Girassol field. They're not really this close together. FPSOsOnce the wells have been dug, the main piece of surface equipment that remains on the scene, especially in deep water fields where pipelines to the seashore are not effective, is the Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) platform. The FPSO is usually an oil tanker that has been retrofitted with special equipment, which often injects water into wells, pumps the resulting oil from the sea floor, performs some processing on the oil (such as removing seawater and gases that have come out with the oil), stores it, and then offloads it to oil tankers, which ship it to market for refining into gasoline and other products. The FPSO substitutes far from shore and in deep water for pipes going directly to shore (the preferred technique for shallows wells close to a politically friendly shoreline).Many billions of dollars typically are invested in developing a single deep water oil field, with hundreds of millions spent on the FPSO alone. According to Wikipedia, the world's largest FPSO is operated by Exxon Mobil near Total's deep water field off Angola: "The world's largest FPSO is the Kizomba A, with a storage capacity of 2.2 million barrels. Built at a cost of over US$800 million by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan, Korea, it is operated by Esso Exploration Angola (ExxonMobil). Located in 1200 meters (3,940 ft) of water at Deepwater block 15,200 statute miles (320 km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean from Angola, West Africa, it weighs 81,000 tonnes and is 285 meters long, 63 meters wide, and 32 meters high ((935 ft by 207 ft by 105 ft)."ROVsToday's ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) go far beyond the little treasure-recovery sub you may have seen in "Titanic." There are ROVs for exploration, rescue, and a wide variety of other undersea activities. Most interesting are the wide variety of ROVs used for excavation -- for dredging channels, for trenching, laying, and burying pipe, and for maintaining the growing variety of undersea equipment. Due to ocean-crossing cables and deep sea oil fields, it is now common for ROVs to conduct their work in thousands of meters of water, far beyond the practical range of divers. A grab excavator ROV. It should be noted that in contrast to space vehciles, where teleprogramming via general commands is the norm, and often involves long time delays between the commands being sent and the results being known to the spacecraft's operators, with undersea operations real-time interaction is the norm. Due to operator fatigue and the costs of maintaining workers on offshore platforms, research is being done on fully automating certain undersea tasks, but the current state of the art remains a human closely in the loop. The costs of maintaining workers on platforms is vastly lower than the cost of maintaining an astronaut in space, so the problem of fully automating undersea operations is correspondingly less important. Nevertheless, many important automation problems, such as the simplification of operations, have had to be solved in order to make it possible for ROVs to replace divers at all. A ROV for digging trenches, used when laying undersea cable or pipe. Another important consideration is that ROVs depend on their tethers to deliver not only instructions but power. An untethered robot lacks power to perform many required operations, especially excavation. At sea as long as the tether is delivering power it might as well deliver real-time interactive instructions and sensor data, i.e. teleoperation as well.Trenching and other high-power ROVs are usually referred to as "work class." There are over 400 collectively worth more than $1.5 billion in operation today and their numbers are increasingly rapidly. Tankers are big, but storms can be bigger. Harsh ConditionsBesides deep water and the peril of storms anywhere at sea, many offshore fields operate under other kinds of harsh conditions. The White Rose and Sea Rose fields of Newfoundland start by excavating "glory holes" dug down into the sea floor to protect the seafloor against icebergs which can project all the way to the fairly shallow sea floor. Inside these holes the oil outflow and fluid injection holes themselves are dug and capped with subsea trees (valves). The drill platform, FPSO, and some of the other equipment has been reinforced to protect against icebergs.In future installments, I'll look at diamond mining and the startups that plan to mine the oceans for copper, gold, and other minerals.
It's the eve of Independence Day here in the United States, celebrating the American insurgents who broke from England. We did have some good inspiration from the Old Countries, as described by this excerpt from a paper of mine:In the 1560s, an “intermittent civil war” started between Protestants and Catholics in France. On St. Bartholomew’s Day, 1572, encouraged by the government authority, mobs murdered “as many as 10,000” Protestants, targeting their leaders. The same year, the Dutch Protestants began their rebellion against the Hapsburg monarchy. Soon thereafter, Theodore Beza, the successor to Calvin, wrote about the right of rebellion and the need to control government so that such rebellion would not be necessary. Beza’s ideas were expanded by an anonymous author, probably the Huguenot Philippe due Plessis-Mornay, in Vindicae Contra Tyrannos. (1579). “If kings commit injustices…they become the enemy,” Plessis-Mornay wrote. But if individuals determined for themselves when to revolt, the result would be violent anarchy. It was, therefore, the role of the Estates and lesser magistrates to guard individual rights against tyrants. According to constitutional historian Scott Gordon, the Huguenots “extended their argumentation to encompass less extreme conflicts between a prince and his subjects. Rebellion is exercised in extremis, but more important are the constraints that operate in ordinary times and bear upon a government that might feel quite secure against insurrection.” The Huguenots and their successors stressed two ways of controlling tyranny that remain crucial to understanding the non-delegation doctrine today: first, control by distributing and checking power; second, control by representation of interests. According to Beza, institutional organs that represent the people “are established to check and bridle the magistrate.”John Locke elaborated on many of these ideas in his Second Treatise On Government. Since humans are unjust towards each other without government, we must form such a government through a compact with each other. We agree to surrender some of our natural rights so that government can function to preserve the remainder. “Absolute arbitrary power, or governing without settled standing laws, can neither of them consist with the ends of society and government, which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for, nor tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their lives, liberties, and fortunes; and by stated rules of right and property to secure their peace and quiet.” Power is also more dangerous if concentrated: “He being in a much worse condition who is exposed to the arbitrary power of one man who has the command of 100,000, than he that is exposed to the arbitrary power of 100,000 single men.”When judicial or executive officers distort the law, with the result that injuries go without remedy, the result is nothing less than a state of war. “Where an appeal to the law and constituted judges lies open, but the remedy is denied by a manifest perverting of justice and barefaced wrestling of the laws, to protect or indemnify the violence or injuries of some men or party of men, there it is hard to imagine anything but a state of war. For whenever violence is used and injury done, though by hands appointed to administer justice, it is still violence and injury, however colored with the name, pretences, or forms of law," Locke wrote.References:Scott Gordon,Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today (Harvard University Press 1999)John Locke, The Second Treatise On Government (1691)
The long reach of habeas corpus was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, in 2004, when it ruled that U.S. citizens detained in Guatanamo Bay, a U.S. military base on long-term lease from Cuba, were on U.S. territory and therefore have a right to plea to a U.S. federal court for habeas corpus and thereby enforce certain minimal liberty rights under the Due Process Clause. The companion case, Rasul v. Bush, declared that aliens (non-citizens) held at an overseas U.S. military base also have this right. However, recently passed legislation, the Military Commissions Act, has suspended habeas corpus protection for all aliens, even the tens of millions of aliens visiting or residing inside the United States proper. It also jeopardizes many of the legal protections U.S. citizens have against arbitrary detainment once we have invoked habeus corpus.In Hamdi Justice Scalia, unusually joined by Justice Stevens, quoted William Blackstone's 18th century legal treatise, parts of which had also been quoted by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist #84: "Of great importance to the public is the preservation of this personal liberty: for if once it were left in the power of any, the highest, magistrate to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought proper ... there would soon be an end of all other rights and immunities. ... To bereave a man of life, or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole kingdom. But confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to gaol, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten; is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government. ..."To make imprisonment lawful, it must either be, by process from the courts of judicature, or by warrant from some legal officer, having authority to commit to prison; which warrant must be in writing, under the hand and seal of the magistrate, and express the causes of the commitment, in order to be examined into (if necessary) upon a habeas corpus. If there be no cause expressed, the gaoler is not bound to detain the prisoner. For the law judges in this respect, ... that it is unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify withal the crimes alleged against him." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 132-133 (1765) (hereinafter Blackstone).Scalia added: It is unthinkable that the Executive could render otherwise criminal grounds for detention noncriminal merely by disclaiming an intent to prosecute, or by asserting that it was incapacitating dangerous offenders rather than punishing wrongdoing. Cf. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 358 (1997) ("A finding of dangerousness, standing alone, is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment"). Both Scalia and Stevens held that this applied to military detentions of U.S. citizens as much as to imprisonment by civilian courts. However Scalia, but not Stevens, made a strong distinction between U.S. citizens and aliens. "Citizens aiding the enemy have been treated as traitors subject to the criminal process," and thus when imprisoned entitled to invoke the federal courts via habeas corpus.The Great Writ has been often been suspended in areas and periods of warfare, allowing armies to capture enemies en masse without incurring legal overhead, but such suspensions have often led to unjust deprivations of liberty. Liberty, as well as life, property, and truth, is a common casualty of war. Without habeas corpus severe political oppression and deprivation of liberty through the practice of disappearing becomes all too easy.Blackstone wrote about the conditions under which the writ might constitutionally be suspended: "And yet sometimes, when the state is in real danger, even this [i.e., executive detention] may be a necessary measure. But the happiness of our constitution is, that it is not left to the executive power to determine when the danger of the state is so great, as to render this measure expedient. For the parliament only, or legislative power, whenever it sees proper, can authorize the crown, by suspending the habeas corpus act for a short and limited time, to imprison suspected persons without giving any reason for so doing... . In like manner this experiment ought only to be tried in case of extreme emergency; and in these the nation parts with it[s] liberty for a while, in order to preserve it for ever." 1 Blackstone 132.Among other constitutional problems with the recently passed legislation, the Military Commissions Act, suspending habeas corpus for aliens, is that it has done so until repealed by Congress, rather than "for a short and limited time." It's also absurd to argue, as some have, that the U.S. currently in a state of "invasion" or "rebellion" as required by the Constitution: The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it. Art. I, §9, cl. 2. In Eisentrager v. Forrestal, the Court had held that German citizens captured in China during World War II and imprisoned in Germany did not have the right to invoke habeas corpus in U.S. federal courts. The special conditions quoted in Eisentrager were as follows: the defendant " (a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States." Although Eisentrager was decided by a court similar to the Court that decided the notorious case of Korematsu, legitimatizing wholesale confiscation of property and internment in concentration camps of innocents in wartime, it does set at least some minimal bounds on what alien combatants may be arbitrarily derived of their liberty.As Justice Stevens wrote in his majority opinion in Rasul: this Court has recognized the federal courts' power to review applications for habeas relief in a wide variety of cases involving Executive detention, in wartime as well as in times of peace. The Court has, for example, entertained the habeas petitions of an American citizen who plotted an attack on military installations during the Civil War, Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1866), and of admitted enemy aliens convicted of war crimes during a declared war and held in the United States, Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), and its insular possessions, In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946).Stevens distinguished the facts in Rasul from those in Eisentrager:Petitioners in these cases differ from the Eisentrager detainees in important respects: They are not nationals of countries at war with the United States, and they deny that they have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against the United States; they have never been afforded access to any tribunal, much less charged with and convicted of wrongdoing; and for more than two years they have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.In concurrence, Justice Kennedy distinguished the Guantanamo Bay detentions from those in Eisentrager as follows:The facts here are distinguishable from those in Eisentrager in two critical ways, leading to the conclusion that a federal court may entertain the [habeas corpus] petitions. First, Guantanamo Bay is in every practical respect a United States territory, and it is one far removed from any hostilities....The second critical set of facts is that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay are being held indefinitely, and without benefit of any legal proceeding to determine their status. In Eisentrager, the prisoners were tried and convicted by a military commission of violating the laws of war and were sentenced to prison terms. Having already been subject to procedures establishing their status, they could not justify "a limited opening of our courts" to show that they were "of friendly personal disposition" and not enemy aliens. [citation omitted] Indefinite detention without trial or other proceeding presents altogether different considerations. It allows friends and foes alike to remain in detention. It suggests a weaker case of military necessity and much greater alignment with the traditional function of habeas corpus. Perhaps, where detainees are taken from a zone of hostilities, detention without proceedings or trial would be justified by military necessity for a matter of weeks; but as the period of detention stretches from months to years, the case for continued detention to meet military exigencies becomes weaker. During the debate over the Military Detentions Act some Senators, such as Arlen Specter (R-PA), argued that the habeas corpus provision of this Act was unconstitutional, but then, pathologically, voted for it anyway. In the early years of the Constitution, it was Congress, not the Courts, who were mainly responsible for making sure legislation stayed within constitutional bounds, and constitutional issues were often debated in Congress and were considered the most decisive issues. Voting for an admittedly unconstitutional Act was a highly irresponsible act. We have a seriously paranoid and unstable situation with Washington D.C. culture and it cannot be predicted how the highly divided Court with two new conservative membes will vote. Not just the Supreme Court, and not just the Executive, but all U.S. citizens, including Congress, are responsible for obeying the Constitution and ensuring that it is obeyed by our leaders.
Ian Grigg's post on Bill Monk reminded me that I had written the following (excerpts from Measuring Value, with a few edits):The value measurement problem is very broad. It comes into play in any system of exchange -- reciprocation of favors, barter, money, credit, employment, or purchase in a market. It is important in extortion, taxation, tribute, and the setting of judicial penalties. It is even important in reciprocal altruism in animals. Consider monkeys exchanging favors -- say pieces of fruit for back scratches. Mutual grooming can remove ticks and fleas that an individual can't see or reach. But just how much grooming versus how many pieces of fruit constitutes a reciprocation that both sides will consider to be "fair," or in other words not a defection? Is twenty minutes of back-scratching worth one piece of fruit or two? And how big a piece? And just how long is twenty minutes anyway? In some cases this is relatively easy to solve, as with the delayed barter of blood for blood in vampire bats. These bats can come home from a hunting mission either overstuffed or starving. Overstuffed bats can regurgitate blood to feed hungry ones. The grateful recipient can remember the favor an return it in a future hunting trip when the tables might be turned. And indeed, some degree of reciprocal trade takes place between vampire bats, even among non-kin.Even this simple case of trading blood for blood, is, however, far more complicated then it seems. Just how do the bats estimate the value of blood they have received? Do they estimate the value of a favor by weight, by bulk, by taste, by its ability to satiate hunger, or other variables? Just the same, measurement complications arise even in the simple monkey exchange of "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours".For the vast majority of potential exchanges, the measurement problem is intractable for animals. Even more than the easier problem of remembering faces and matching them to favors, the ability of both parties to agree with sufficient accuracy on an estimate of the value of a favor in the first place is probably the main barrier to reciprocal altruism among animals.It is also likely the most important barrier to exchange among humans. Many kinds of exchange, probably many more than most economists perceive, are rendered infeasible by the inability of one or both parties to the exchange to estimate its value. For most of human history, most kinds of markets that are possible today were not then feasible, in large part due to the inability of potential market participants to measure value: to estimate the value of the transaction to themselves and then use these estimates to discover and agree on a common objective measurement. Measurement of value was and is also important to the development of many economic institutions related to markets. Accounting was crucial to the development of large companies and modern systems of taxation.The process of determining the value of a product from observations is necessarily incomplete and costly. For example, a shopper can see that an apple is shiny red. This has some correlation to its tastiness (the quality a typical shopper actually wants from an apple), but it's hardly perfect. The apple's appearance is not a complete indicator -- an apple sometimes has a rotten spot down inside even if the surface is perfectly shiny and red. Yoram Barzel calls an indirect measure of value -- for example the shininess, redness, or weight of the apple -- a proxy measure. In fact, all measures of value, besides prices in an ideal market, are proxy measures -- real value is subjective and largely tacit.Such observations also come at a cost. It may take some time to sort through apples to find the shiniest and reddest ones, and meanwhile the shopper bruises the other apples. It costs the vendor to put on a fake shiny gloss of wax, and it costs the shopper because he may be fooled by the wax, and because he has to eat wax with his apple. Sometimes these measurement costs comes about just from the imperfection of honest communication. In other cases, such as waxing the apple, the cost occurs because rationally self-interested parties play games with the observable.Measures are critical components of institutions-- such as auctions, contracts, accounting systems, legal damage rules, tax rules, etc. -- that align incentives between parties who, prior to participating in the institution, have incompatible incentives. We can divide the measurement problem into two components -- the first, choosing the phenomena and units that will be measured, and second, measuring those attributes in a way that minimizes spoofing of the measure between parties whose incentives with respect to the value are misaligned.Cost can usually be measured far more objectively than value. As a result, the most common proxy measures are various kinds of costs. Examples include:(a) paying for employment in terms of time worked, rather than by quantity produced (piece rates) or other possible measures. Time measures sacrifice, i.e. the cost of opportunities foregone by the employee.(b) most numbers recorded and reported by accountants for assets are costs rather than market prices expected to be recovered by the sale of assets.(c) non-fiat money and collectibles obtain their value primarily from their scarcity, i.e. their cost of replacement.
"Technological neutrality" is a hot topic in government surveillance law.  It posits that new technologies (such as WiFi and cryptography) that enhance privacy should be required, by law, to be altered in order to provide governments the same amount of ability to spy on private conversations as they had with previous technology.  The argument is that we must decrease our legal rights in order to hold constant governments' abilities to spy on us.A big assumption lies in choosing the technological baseline of surveillance.   Usually this is, conveniently for governments, chosen to correspond to some high-water mark of surveillance, for example the copper era when phone exchanges were centralized and wiretaps required only splicing together copper cables.The most accurate baseline, however, is the baseline abilities of surveillance that our laws, especially our Constitutional laws, were designed for.  In the United States, the Fourth Amendment was designed for a world in which governments had no ability to wiretap.  If a government wanted to spy on your conversation they had to do it the same way they can still do now -- by following you around and listening in person (or at least in the next room).   On very rare occasions, you might write a letter and the government might open your mail, for which "paper" the Fourth Amendment required a search warrant based on swearing under oath that there was probable cause to suspect a crime related to that mail.In short, the "technological neutrality" argument, if applied correctly, leads to the opposite conclusion reached by its proponents.  Rather than reacting to privacy technologies by reducing further our legal rights, instead we should be expanding our legal privacy rights and encouraging privacy technologies until we return to the baseline of government surveillance abilities for which the Fourth Amendment and similar protections were designed.
Tyler Cowen posits that we are going through a Great Stagnation.   Civilization has harvested the low hanging fruit of the internal combustion engine, electricity, and so on that drove great increases in value and productivity from the end of the nineteenth century.  But we have made so few similarly productive discoveries in recent decades that as a result progress is slowing down.  Markets have thus overestimated economic growth, resulting in the dot-com bubble and crash and the more recent market problems as real estate prices failed to keep pace with expectations.  This thesis echoes much that Peter Thiel and others have been saying, that the financial industry has, in its expectations about financial returns, been counting on 20th century levels of economic growth in the developed world but instead has hit the reality of lower growth rates here, resulting in market volatility and drops.These pessimistic observations of long-term economic growth are in many ways a much needed splash of cold water in the face for the Kurzweilian "The Singularity is Near" crowd, the people who think nearly everything important has been growing exponentially.  And it is understandable for an economist to observe a great stagnation because there has indeed been a great stagnation in real wages as economists measure them: real wages in the developed world grew spectacularly during most of the 20th century but have failed to grow during the last thirty years.  Nevertheless Cowen et. al. are being too pessimistic, reacting too much to the recent market problems.  (Indeed the growing popularity of pessimistic observations of great stagnations, peak oil, and the like strongly suggest it's a good time to be long the stock markets!)    These melancholy stories fail to take into account the great recent increases in value that are subjectively obvious to almost all good observers who have lived through the last twenty years but that economists have been unable to measure. In many traditional industries, such as transportation and real estate, the pessimistic thesis is largely true.  The real costs of commuting, buying real estate near where my friends are and where I want to work, of getting a traditional college education, and a number of other important things have risen significantly over the past twenty years.   These industries are going backwards, becoming less efficient, delivering less value at higher cost: if we could measure their productivity it would be falling.On the other hand, the costs of manufacturing goods whose costs primarily reflect manufacturing rather than raw materials has fallen substantially over the least twenty years, at about the same rate as in prior decades.  Of course, most of these gains have been in the developing and BRICs countries, for a variety of reasons, such as the higher costs of regulation in the developed world and the greater access to cheaper labor elsewhere, but those of us in the U.S., Europe and Japan still benefit via cheap imports that allow us to save more of our money for other things.  But perhaps even more importantly, outside of traditional education and mass media we have seen a knowledge and entertainment sharing revolution of unprecedented value.    I argue that what looks like a Great Stagnation in the traditional market economy is to a significant extent a product of a vast growth in economic value that has occurred on the Internet and largely outside of the traditional market economy, and a corresponding cannibalization of and brain drain from traditional market businesses.Most of the economic growth during the Internet era has been largely unmonetized, i.e. external to the measurable market.   This is most obvious for completely free services like Craig's List, Wikipedia, many blogs, open source software, and many other services based on content input by users.   But ad-funded Internet services also usually create a much greater value than is captured by the advertising revenues.  These include search, social networking, many online games, broadcast messaging, and many other services.    Only a small fraction of the Internet's overall value has been monetized.   In other words, the vast majority of the Internet's value is what economists call an externality: it is external to the measurable prices of the market.  Of course, since this value is unmeasured, this thesis is extremely hard to prove or disprove, and can hardly be called scientific; mainly it just strikes me as subjectively obvious.   "Social science" can't explain most things about society and this is one of them.What's worse for the traditional market (as opposed to this recent tsunami of unmonetized voluntary information exchange), this tidal wave of value has greatly reduced the revenues of certain industries.   The direct connection the Internet provides between authors and the readers put out of business many bookstores.  Online classifieds and free news sources have cannibalized newspapers and magazines.   Wikipedia is destroying demand for the traditional encyclopedia.    Free and cut-price music has caused a substantial decline in music industry revenues.  So the overall effect is a great increase in value combined with a perhaps small, but I'd guess significant reduction in what GDP growth would have been without the Internet.What are some of the practical consequences?  Twenty years ago most smart people did not have an encyclopedia in the home or at the office.   Now the vast majority in the developed and even hundreds of millions in the BRICs countries do, and many even have it in the car or on the train.  Twenty years ago it was very inconvenient and cost money to place a tiny classified ad that could only be seen in the local newspaper; now it is very easy and free to place an ad of proper length that can be seen all over the world.   Search engines combined with mass voluntary and generally free submission of content to the Internet has increased the potential knowledge we have ready access to thousands-fold.   Social networking allows us to easily reconnect with old friends we'd long lost contact with.   Each of us has access to much larger libraries of music and written works.   We have access to a vast "long tail" of specialized content that the traditional mass media never provided us.     The barriers to a smart person with worthwhile thoughts getting fellow humans to attend to those thoughts are far lower than what they were twenty years ago.   And almost none of this can be measured in market prices, so almost none of it shows up in the economic figures on which economists focus.Cowen suggests that external gains of similar magnitude occurred in prior productivity revolutions, but I'm skeptical of this claim.  A physical widget can be far more completely monetized than a piece of information, because it is excludable: if you don't pay, you don't get the widget.   As opposed to information that computers readily copy.   (The most underappreciated function of computers is that they are far better copy machines than the paper copiers).   It's true that competition drove down prices.   But the result was still largely monetized as greater value caused increased demand, whereas growth in the use of search engines, Twitter, Wikipedia, Facebook etc. largely just requires adding a few more computers that now cost far less than the value they convey.   (Yes, I'm well aware of scaling issues in software engineering, but they typically don't require much more than a handful of smart computer scientists to solve).  Due to Moore's Law the computers that drive the Internet have radically increased in functionality per dollar since the dawn of the Internet.   Twitter's total capital equipment purchases, R&D, and user acquisition expenditures are less than fifty cents per registered user and these capital investment costs per user continue to drop at a ferocious rate for Internet businesses and non-profits.The brain drain from traditional industries can be seen in, for example, the great increase in the proportion of books on computer programming, HTML, and the like on bookstore shelves to traditional engineering and technical disciplines from mechanical engineering to plumbing.   It is not so blatant in the relative growth of computer science and electrical engineering relative to other engineering disciplines, but that's just the tip of the iceberg and vast numbers of non-computer scientists, including many with engineering degrees or technical training in other areas, have ended up as computer programmers.  Fortunately, the Internet is giving a vast new generation of smart people access to knowledge who never had it before.    The number of smart people who can learn an engineering discipline has probably increased by nearly a factor of ten over the last twenty years (again largely in the BRICs and developing world of course).    The number who can actually get a degree of course has not -- which gives rise to a great economic challenge -- what are good ways for this vast new population of educated smart people to prove their intelligence and knowledge when traditional education with its degrees of varying prestige is essentially a zero-sum status game that excludes them?   How do we get them in regular social contact with more traditionally credentialed smart people?  The Internet may solve much of the problem of finding fellow smart people who share our interests and skills, but we still emotionally bond with people over dinner not over Facebook.  As for the great stagnation in real wages in particular, the biggest reason is probably the extraordinarily rapid pace at which the BRICs and developing world has become educated and accessible to the developed world since the Cold War.  In other words, outsourcing has in a temporary post-Cold-War spree outraced the ability of most of us in the developed world to retrain to the more advanced industries.  The most unappreciated reason, and the biggest reason retraining for newer industries has been so difficult, is that unmonetized value provides no paying jobs, but may destroy such jobs when it causes the decline of some traditionally monetized industries.   On the Internet the developed world is providing vast value to the BRICs and developing world, but that value is largely unmonetized and thus produces relatively few jobs in the developed world.   The focus of the developed world on largely unmonetized, though extremely valuable, activities has been a significant cause of wage stagnation in the developed world and of skill and thus wage increases in the developing world.    Whereas before they were buying our movies, music, books, and news services, increasingly they are just getting our free stuff on the Internet.   The most important new industry of the last twenty years has been mostly unmonetized and thus hasn't provide very many jobs to retrain for, relative to the value it has produced.And of course there are the challenges of the traditional industries that gave us the industrial revolution and 20th century economic growth in the first place.   Starting with the most basic and essential: agriculture, extraction, and mass manufacturing.   By no means should these be taken for granted; they are the edifice on which all the remainder rests.    Gains in agriculture and extraction may be diminishing as the easy pickings (given sufficiently industrial technology and a sufficiently elaborated division of labor) of providing scarce nutrients and killing pests in agriculture and the geologically concentrated ores are becoming history. Can the great knowledge gains from the Internet be fed back to improve the productivities of our most basic industries, especially in the face of Malthusian depletion of the low hanging fruit of soil productivity and geological wealth?   That remains to be seen, but despite all the market troubles and run-up in commodity prices, which have far more to do with financial policies than with the real costs of extracting commodities, I remain optimistic.   We still have very large and untapped physical frontiers.    These tend to be, for the near future, below us rather than above us, which flies in the face of our spiritual yearnings (although for space fans here is the most promising possible exception to this rule I have encountered).    The developing world may win these new physical frontiers due to the high political value the developed world places on environmental cleanliness, which has forced many dirty but crucial businesses overseas.  Industries that involve far more complex things, like medicine and the future of the Internet itself, are far more difficult to predict. But the simple physical frontiers as well as the complex medical and social frontiers are all there, waiting for our new generations with their much larger number of much more knowledgeable people to tap them.
David Chaum's dining cryptgraphers network is a nifty alternative to his digital mix to untraceably share encrypted information. But it suffers from the problem that since the participants are untraceable, one or more of them can jam the channel, preventing other participants from having their messages received. Bryan Turner has figured out a way to find the jammers if they are less than one-third of the total participants. Presumably this is accomplished without being able to find out much of anything else interesting about a participant. I suggest that a similar technique may also work for a jamming attack in a secure multiparty computation.
The late Chief Justice William Rehnquist entitled his book on the history of civil rights during wartime "All The Laws But One."   The title is from a quote by Abraham Lincoln complaining about the judicial system's protection of the rights of alleged conspirators even during the Civil War: "Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself to go to pieces, lest that one be violated?"  The "one" law being the liberty the court was trying to preserve.   This is one of the most abused quotes in American legal thought, and it has seldom been abused as often as it is being now.First of all, even from Lincoln the question was rhetorical and the rhetoric was exaggerated.  Even had the North lost the Civil War, some very desirable laws would have taken a beating (e.g. laws that ended up being promulgated to ban slavery in the South), but the execution of most other laws would have gone ahead as before.  Furthermore, most of the cases being adjudicated typically occurred well away from enemy lines and in late stages of the war when there was no serious danger of the South winning.Nevertheless, Abraham Lincoln faced a far more difficult problem with the execution of the laws than governments fighting the "War on Terror" face today.    When Lincoln made this quote it was plausible; applying it to today's situation is not.   Despite the difficulties the Union faced, its judiciary endeavored to preserve the rights of civilians against military encroachment.   One very good result of that, which should be closely heeded by Courts today, is Ex Parte Milligan.   Despite a Civil War far more damaging to the normal execution of the laws than any imminent threat the United States has ever faced since, the Court held for liberty in wartime against the encroachment of authoritarian military justice.Civil liberties take their greatest hits during wartime.  First Amendment rights were violated in the United States after the French Revolution when the States were threatened by further rebellion and being drawn into the ensuing war between England and France.   They were again trampled upon during World War I.   The Holocaust in Germany and Korematsu in the United States occurred during World War II.   Vigilance in protecting our liberties is at no time more important than during a perceived or actual "war."Many argue that today we are again at war: the "War on Terror."  If the Soviet Union had attacked the United States on 9/11, we would have gone to war with them, so the argument goes.   Actually, the Soviet Union did attack the passenger airplane of a  close ally, South Korea, killing several hundred people including many United States citizens and a United States Congressman.  There was no serious argument at the time that this was an act of war.   An act of war occurs not merely from an attack, but from an attack that seriously damages our military and threatens our territory, for example the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.   That attack was no isolated attack for the sake of  killing people and making headlines, but a very serious and, at least initially, very successful attempt to destroy American naval might and capture large pieces of its territory (e.g. the Philippines) and territory of its allies (French Indochina, Dutch Indonesia, etc.)  Al Quaeda is full of some very sick people and stirs up quit a bit of torrid television coverage, but it is not a threat comparable to Imperial Japan.Unlike earlier wars fought between governments to a conclusion,  a "War on Terror" will last forever.  It's like fighting a "War on Blitzkrieg" or a "War On Drugs" or a "War on Murder."   Terrorism is a particularly evil type of violence that has plagued humankind since the dawn of history, and there is no sign that the evils of terrorism will be eliminated any time soon.Professor Burt Neuborne of New York University School of Law compares the authoritarian military justice system with our civilian justice system.  Some societies, such as China, have a justice system runs as if the society was in a permanent state of war -- as indeed might characterize the antagonistic relationship between Party members and the rest of society there.   In the United States the justice system is bifurcated, with the authoritarian military justice system reserved for military personnel or enemies in war.  Neuborne observes that the authoritarian system that typically takes over governments during wartime makes three large errors in the pursuit of security that impact liberty: it overstates risks, it generates many false positives (i.e. persecutes people thought to be risky but actually innocent), and it is overly harsh.   The current abuse of Lincoln's quote is an extreme example of overstating the risks.  The Jews killed by Germany and the Japanese interned by the United States are extreme examples of false positives, and, at least of the former, of overly harsh reactions.We must thus confront the question: are we to compromise our constitutional liberties and natural rights for the sake of a "war" of a very different kind and degree faced in Ex Parte Milligan?    Assuming we are indeed at war, with an enemy that wears no uniform and may include American residents and American citizens, who gets to decide who is an "enemy combatant,” to be herded into the authoritarian military justice system, and who is just another alleged criminal with full constitutional rights?  Those among us who long for more authority and destruction of liberty on the model of China, Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or some aspects of the United States itself during World War II, or who negligently ignore these nasty lessons of history, let their pining for security overcome them and argue that we can trust the authoritarian military justice system.  In a free society it is the civilian courts, or at least courts with procedural protections comparable to the civilian courts, that ought to make that initial determination.   In a free society it is the civilian courts under the fully unfurled umbrella of a constitution which should thereafter handle people who are not enemy combatants of a war power that threatens the very execution of our laws, but are just particularly evil and destructive criminals.
Abstract money today primarily involves accounts and other computerized bits, but traditionally came in the form of paper.  The Chinese, who invented paper money called it "flying money." Abstract money is worthwhile because the dominant kind of money over human evolution, unforgeably costly commodities, can be quite costly to store and transport compared to abstract documents. For money the biggest costs of storage and transportation are typically not mundane real estate or carriage costs, but active security threats such as robbery and embezzlement.Abstract documents, unlike unforgeably costly commodities, require trust in a human institution to enforce the abstract claims of value made in the document. This enforcement, if effective, lets the recipient of the document be confident that it can be converted into something of value, traditionally an unforgeably costly commodity that backs the document. If the recipient of the document wants to trade the document to third parties -- negotiate it -- this enforcement may also provide confidence to these third parties that they too can receive something of value in exchange for relinquishing the abstract claim.Enforcement typically came in the form of legal and reputation systems. For example, the Medieval European law merchant enforced contracts and monetary promises in the merchants' own courts, with remedies such as bankruptcy and expulsion from merchant guilds. Bosses (principals) enforced orders against their employees (agents), and there were also often family relationships within firms that increased trust within the firm.In most modern legal systems, and in many traditional legal and merchant reputation systems, credit money has come in two basic forms -- drafts, or orders from a boss to his employee (in legal jargon, from a principal to his agent) to transfer goods to a certain person, and notes, or promises to transfer goods to a certain person. A draft was enforced privately, by the ways bosses normally discipline employees; a promise to pay was enforced by an enforcement agency, often a government, by reputation among merchants, or both. Often the document reifying money that we will examine took on both of these roles.The draft, in particular the warehouse receipt, is probably oldest form of credit document. Warehouse receipts are issued to document the storage of personal property in a warehouse. Typically, a warehouse receipt is an acknowledgement that the warehouseman is holding the owner's goods. The receipt acts as a title to the goods; transferring the receipt is as good as transferring the goods. The receipt acts as an instruction to the warehouseman's agent to release the goods to whoever presents the receipt. Thus, it is more properly categorized as a draft (an order to an agent) than a note (a promise to pay), although in some ways and in some legal systems it has been treated as both.Another kind of draft is a bill of lading. This is a receipt for transported goods, and an order for the transport agent at the other end to release the goods to a person authorized by the shipper to receive them.Description of illustrations(in order):  Sumerican clay envelope c. 3,500 B.C., probably a warehouse receipt or a billing of lading; plate for Chinese paper money, c. 1279 A.D., with recent print from that plate; private bank note of the Bank of Scotland, 1716; Early Mormon private bank (Kirkland Safety Society, Ohio, U.S.A.) note signed by Joseph Smith, 1837; private bank note from a private road and bridge operating company (Delaware Bridge Company, New Jersey, U.S.A.) 1838; warehouse receipt for silver with micro-barcodes 2002.
Game-based virtual property is something I'll have more to say about in the future.  It might give us some insight on how other kinds of purely or primarily online property may develop.  Of course, game-based virtual property is no more "imaginary" than any other kind of property.  Its value, like that of any other property, is based directly on the various preferences people have for it, as well as well as on its supply, and only indirectly on attributes of the property on which those preferences are based.  Those attributes may be tangible or intangible.One interesting issue for game-based property is whether inter-game trade in it ruins the sport of the game.  Imagine, for example, if in baseball the New York Yankees could buy not only bid for the best players, but could directly buy bases.  Or even just barter bases between games.  Imagine the Texas Rangers allowing the Yankees to turn a double into a home run, in exchange for two extra runs for the Rangers in a Yankees-Rangers game next year, so that the Yankees could beat the Boston Red Sox this year for the eastern division title.  A "level playing field" that is considered necessary for sports to be "sporting" seems to require various restrictions on trade.  The goal of a sport or game is typically not efficiency in scoring runs or accumulating "gold pieces," but entertainment.Many people justify trade restrictions outside the realm of sports and games, where efficiency is quite important, on the same kind of ethics.  The results are often wasteful, and sometimes disastrous.
Tyler Cowen observes that those who have influence over the value of their local currency (usually government leaders and central bankers) and who hold most of their assets in a foreign currency have a strong incentive to take actions that depreciate the local government currency that they control.  On the other hand, I'd add, if those trusted with the value of a currency hold unhedged long-term debt denominated in a that currency, this provides a good insurance policy for other holders of that currency.   (Although going too far in this direction incentivizes deflation). I suggest that government leaders, central bank directors, and the like be publicly audited with this in mind, similar to the laws that require disclosure by company insiders when they buy, sell, or hedge their company's stock.
In today's decision in MedImmune v. Genentech, the U.S. Supreme Court held  that (possibly subject to a caveat described below) a patent licensee can sue to get out of the license without having to infringe the patent first.  In other words, the licensee can sue without stopping the license payments.  This sounds like some minor procedural point. It is a procedural point but it is hardly minor. It dramatically changes the risks of infringement and invalidity, and on whom those risks are placed, in a licensing relationship.The Court's opinion today reverses the doctrine of the Federal Circuit, the normal appeals court for U.S. patents, that had held that there was no standing for a patent licensee to sue until it had actually infringed the patent or breached the contract. This meant that the licensee had to risk triple damages (for intentional infringement) and other potential problems in order to have a court determine whether the patent was valid or being infringed. This could be harsh, and it has long been argued that such consequences coerce licensees into continuing to pay license fees for products that it has discovered are not really covered by the patent.Given the fuzziness of the "metes and bounds" of patents, this is a common occurrence. Sometimes the licensee's engineers come up with an alternative design that seems to avoid the patent, but the licensee is too scared of triple damages if the court decides otherwise and sticks with the patented product and paying the license fees. At other times new prior art is discovered or some other research uncovers the probable invalidity of the patent. But enough uncertainty remains that , given the threat of triple damages, the licensee just keeps paying the license fees.A caveat is that the licensor may have to first "threaten" the licensee somehow that they will take action if the licensee doesn't make the expected payments or introduces a new product not covered by the license.  In this case that "threat" took the form of an opinion letter from the licensor that the licensee's new product was covered by the old patent, and thus that the licensee had to pay license fees for the new productJustice Scalia wrote the opinion for the eight justice majority. He argued that if the only difference between a justiciable controversy (i.e. a case where the plaintiff has standing under "case or controversy" clause of the U.S Constitution) and a non-justiciable one (i.e. no standing to sue) is that the plaintiff chose not to violate the disputed law, then the plaintiff still has standing:The plaintiff's own action (or inaction) in failing to violate the law eliminates the imminent threat of prosecution, but nonetheless does not eliminate Article III jurisdiction. For example, in Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U. S. 197 (1923), the State threatened the plaintiff with forfeiture of his farm, fines, and penalties if he entered into a lease with an alien in violation of the State's anti-alien land law. Given this genuine threat of enforcement, we did not require, as a prerequisite to testing the validity of the law in a suit for injunction, that the plaintiff bet the farm, so to speak, by taking the violative action.One of the main purposes of the Declaratory Judgments Act, under which such lawsuits are brought, is to avoid the necessity of committing an illegal act before the case can be brought to court:Likewise, in Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452 (1974), we did not require the plaintiff to proceed to distribute handbills and risk actual prosecution before he could seek a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of a state statute prohibiting such distribution. Id., at 458, 460. As then-Justice Rehnquist put it in his concurrence, "the declaratory judgment procedure is an alternative to pursuit of the arguably illegal activity." Id., at 480. In each of these cases, the plaintiff had eliminated the imminent threat of harm by simply not doing what he claimed the right to do (enter into a lease, or distribute handbills at the shopping center). That did not preclude subject matter jurisdiction because the threat-eliminating behavior was effectively coerced. See Terrace, supra, at 215. 216; Steffel, supra, at 459. The dilemma posed by that coercion "putting the challenger to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking prosecution" is "a dilemma that it was the very purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act to ameliorate." Abbott Laboratories v.Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 152 (1967).Scalia, who is normally no fan of easy standing, extended this doctrine from disputes with the government to private disputes. For this he used as precedent Altvater v. Freeman:The Federal Circuit's Gen-Probe decision [the case in which the Federal Circuit established its doctrine which the Supreme Court today reversed] distinguished Altvater on the ground that it involved the compulsion of an injunction. But Altvater cannot be so readily dismissed. Never mind that the injunction had been privately obtained and was ultimately within the control ofthe patentees, who could permit its modification. More fundamentally, and contrary to the Federal Circuit's conclusion, Altvater did not say that the coercion dispositive of the case was governmental, but suggested just the opposite. The opinion acknowledged that the licensees had the option of stopping payments in defiance of the injunction, but explained that the consequence of doing so would be to risk "actual [and] treble damages in infringement suits" by the patentees. 319 U. S., at 365. It significantly did not mention the threat of prosecution for contempt, or any other sort of governmental sanction.Scalia as usual got to the point:The rule that a plaintiff must destroy a large building, bet the farm, or(as here) risk treble damages and the loss of 80 percent of its business, before seeking a declaration of its actively contested legal rights finds no support in Article III.Scalia rebutted the argument that under freedom of contract the parties had a right to, and had here, created an "insurance policy" immunizing the licensor from declaratory lawsuits:Promising to pay royalties on patents that have not been held invalid does not amount to a promise not to seek a holding of their invalidity.The lessons of this case also apply to copyright and other kinds of IP, albeit in different ways. In copyright one can be exposed to criminal sanctions for infringement so there is an even stronger case for declaratory lawsuits.The most interesting issue is to what extent IP licensors will be able to "contract around" this holding and thus still be able to immunize themselves from pre-infringement lawsuits. It's possible that IP licensors will still be able to prevent their licensees from suing with the proper contractual language. Licensees on the other hand may want to insist on language that preserves their rights to sue for declaratory judgments on whether the IP they are licensing is valid or on whether they are really infringing it with activities for which they wish to not pay license fees. If there's interest, I'll post in the future if I see good ideas for such language, and if I have some good ideas of my own I'll post those. This will be a big topic among IP license lawyers for the foreseeable future, as Scalia's opinion left a raft of issues wide open, including the issues about how such language would now be interpreted.I will later update this post with links to the opinions (I have them via e-mail from Professor Hal Wegner).UPDATE: Straight from the horse's mouth, here is the slip opinion.
Here are some interesting bits about shells as money etc.
A sample of 12,801 individuals in 1,849 households and in 47 geographical locations shows that the death rate in Iraq increased from 5.5 people thousand people before the U.S. invasion to 13.3 per thousand after. This is almost entirely due to a vast increase in the number of violent deaths.This implies that about two hundred (200) times as many extra Iraqis have been killed since the U.S. invasion as the number of Americans killed on 9/11. While most of the deaths in the first year were attributed to the U.S.-led forces, most of the deaths since are attributed to insurgents. The study controlled for reporter bias by checking actual death certificates and finding them in 92% of the cases -- pretty good record-keeping and truth-telling for such a chaotic land.Here is the study. Here is a good discussion of the study.Just one.
After about 1000 AD northwestern Europe started a gradual switch from using oxen to using horses for farm traction and transportation.  This trend culminated in an eighteenth-century explosion in roads carrying horse-drawn carriages and wagons, as well as in canals, and works greatly extending the navigability of rivers, both carrying horse-drawn barges. This reflected a great rise in the use of cultivated fodder, a hallmark of the novel agricultural system that was evolving in northwestern Europe from the start of the second millennium: stationary pastoralism.  During the same period, and especially in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, most of civilized East Asia, and in particular Chinese civilization along its coast, navigable rivers, and canals, faced increasing Malthusian pressures and evolved in the opposite direction: from oxen towards far more costly and limited human porters. Through the early middle ages China had been far ahead, in terms of division of labor and technology, of the roving bandits of northern Europe, but after the latter region's transition to stationary pastoralism that gap closed and Europe surged ahead, a growth divergence that culminated in the industrial revolution.  In the eighteenth century Europe, and thus in the early industrial revolution, muscle power was the engine of land transportation, and hay was its gasoline.  Metcalfe's Law states that a value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its nodes.  In an area where good soils, mines, and forests are randomly distributed, the number of nodes valuable to an industrial economy is proportional to the area encompassed.  The number of such nodes that can be economically accessed is an inverse square of the cost per mile of transportation.  Combine this  with Metcalfe's Law and we reach a dramatic but solid mathematical conclusion: the potential value of a land transportation network is the inverse fourth power of the cost of that transportation. A reduction in transportation costs in a trade network by a factor of two increases the potential value of that network by a factor of sixteen. While a power of exactly 4.0 will usually be too high, due to redundancies, this does show how the cost of transportation can have a radical nonlinear impact on the value of the trade networks it enables.  This formalizes Adam Smith's observations: the division of labor (and thus value of an economy) increases with the extent of the market, and the extent of the market is heavily influenced by transportation costs (as he extensively discussed in his Wealth of Nations).The early industrial revolution was highly dependent on bringing together bulk goods such as coal and iron ore.  Land transportation of such materials more than a dozen miles in most parts of the world was prohibitively costly, and they were only rarely located a shorter distance from navigable water (the costs per mile of water transport were generally orders of magnitude cheaper than the costs per mile of of land transport).  As a result, the early industrial revolution, and the potential for a region to be the first to industrialize, was very sensitive to small changes in land transportation costs.Furthermore, land and sea-borne transportation were far more complements than substitutes.  Cheaper land transportation was a "force multiplier" for water transportation.  Decreasing the costs of getting to port from field or mine by a factor of two increased the number of fields and mines accessible by a factor of four, and increased the number of possible ways to divide labor, and thus the value, by an even greater factor via Metcalfe's law.  This in turn incentived greater investment in sea-borne transport. It's thus not surprising that, even before the industrial revolution, the leaders in global trade and colonization were European countries that could access the Atlantic.By the dawn of the industrial revolution in northwest Europe the effects of horse haulage had already been dramatic: drop by a factor of two in the costs, and increase in speed by about the same factor, of transporting goods by land, the corresponding increase in commercial crop area and in area that could be economically lumbered and coal and metals that could be mined.   Multiply that factor of four by much more when we factor in (1) innovations in wheels, tires, shock absorption, and road building that followed on the heels, as is were, of the great increase in horse haulage, and (2) the great increase in mileage and inland penetration of navigable rivers and canals, especially in the 18th century, the barges again hauled by horses.  And as Metcalfe's Law suggests, the number of combinations, and thus the value, increased by a far greater factor still. Not only did northwestern European ports have access to far more land, but there were far more ports far more "inland" along rivers and canals, thanks again chiefly to the draft horses and the nutrient-rich cultivated fodder that fed them.To enable the industrial revolution, mines and nutrient-dense fodder had to be colocated within efficient bulk transport distance of each other — which in the case of horses hauling coal or wood by rural road, was typically less than twenty miles, and for oxen and human porters far less still — to produce the low-cost bulk transportation networks needed to make industrial revolution scale use of most commercial crops and mines. Efficient bulk transportation is needed _all the way_ between the iron mine, the coal mine, and the smelter.  Because the cost per mile of water transport was so much smaller than the costs of land transport, this “last few miles to the mine” problem usually played a dominant role in transportation economics, somewhat analogous to the “last mile” problem in modern cable networks. That’s why stationary pastoralism with its efficient markets for nutrient-dense (because cultivated) fodder was such a huge win — it allowed horses to be housed at the mines, canals, roads, and factories where they worked, which no place in the world outside Europe could during that era do.  Nutrient-dense fodder created a virtuous recursion, enabling itself to be harvested (via horse-drawn mows and rakes) and transported to mine, factory, and stable at increasingly lower costs.Industrialization came in many phases. Very roughly speaking, the first phase, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, involved the culmination and optimization of the use of horses, by northwestern Europe, and especially England, greatly expanding its horse wagon and carriage roads and horse-drawn barge canal networks.  Horses brought coke or charcoal and iron ore to the smelters. Horse-powered capstans performed some arduous farm tasks such as threshing. Along with primitive Newcomen steam engines they pumped coal mines. Horse gins also powered most of the early versions of innovative textile machinery (they switched to more power-efficient water mills when they later scaled up).  That classic carnival ride, the merry-go-round, was inspired by these perpetually circling horses.Again roughly speaking, the second phase of industrial growth, after about 1830, was more scientific and far easier to copy than northwestern Europe's unique biology: steam engines came to replace horse gins and water mills for running industrial machinery, and the steam-powered railroad radically lowered transportation costs between major mines, factories, and urban centers. When non-European countries industrialized, such as Japan after the 1870s, they did it in a "leap-frog" style: they skipped over the long-evolved improvement in draft animals and went straight to mature steam engines and, soon thereafter, electrical motors.  Much as countries installing phone networks for the first time over the last few decades have leap-frogged over the land line era, going straight to cell phones. Starting early in the 20th century industrializing countries could replace all the remaining important functions of the horse with internal combustion engines.  England, which made the longest and most thorough use of the horse, and thereby had the transportation economies allowing it to pioneer the industrial revolution, had a less pressing need to use the internal combustion engine and thus lagged enough in that technology so that second-generation  industrializers like Japan, Germany, and the United States became leaders in internal combustion engine products.Given the scientific nature of the second phase of the industrial revolution, which could be discovered by any culture full of literate craftsmen, this second phase was more technologically inevitable and didn't ultimately depend on northwestern Europe's unique biology.  At the same time, during the long evolution that culminate in the industrial revolution, and during its first phase, land transportation the world over was muscle powered and the unique system of stationary pastoralism, by breeding draft horses that ran on cultivated, nutrient-dense fodder, substantially lowered transportation costs. This allowed the value of northwestern Europe's bulk transportation networks to radically increase and made it very nearly as inevitable that that region would be the pioneers of the industrial revolution.Hat tips and references: Edward Wright and Raymond Crotty among many other authors have explored some of these issues.Raymond CrottyRaymond Crottyamong many other authors have explored some of the issues.
Why did agricultural civilization remain mired in the Malthusian trap for over 5,000 years?   And how was it possible to eventually escape from it?  Recall the Malthusian isoclines and how various kinds of societies can be situated along them (click to enlarge all graphs):Plagues move the economy “northwest” along the isoclines, as more marginal lands are abandoned leaving the fewer people to work and share the more productive lands.   Births beyond replacement by contrast move the economy “southeast” towards higher population, the use of more marginal lands, and thus a lower standard of living.   Here, for example, is a graph using actual statistics for English real farm labor wage income from 1260 to 1849.  Even though England during this period was slowly escaping from the Malthusian trap -- note that each 80 years has advanced farther "northeast" than the previous 80 -- it still followed the basic Malthusian pattern of births and deaths.  Observe how the real wage greatly increased after the Black Plague in the mid-14th century, then slowly declines thereafter: Much less well appreciated than the effects of births and plagues with respect to the Malthusian isocline are creation and destruction of productive capital.  Every act of plowing, sowing, weeding, and so on was a seasonal capital investment, and the resulting harvest (and thus the short-term isocline) depended on the qualities and quantities of these short-term investments, as well as on vagaries of pests, weather, etc.  Longer-term capital investment could include conditioning, fertilizing, and draining soil, buying livestock, breeding crops and livestock, watering meadows, and so on.   Long term progress towards the "northeast" depended on long-term accumulation of capital.   It was exceedingly rare to maintain such progress over long periods of time, and the British capital accumulation over such a long period, leading to the breakout from the Malthusian trap, was unprecedented.Good harvests caused progress that was temporary unless the food was stored and long-term capital investment was substituted for investment in next year’s harvest as well as other pursuits such as luxury and military buildup.   Productive innovation, whether institutional or technological, also led to moving the isoclines “northeast”, as they made capital more secure or productive.Poor harvests (from pests, poor weather, etc.) caused a setback that was temporary as long as it didn’t lead to the destruction of capital.   If it resulted in starvation, the deaths boosted the economy up the isocline, so that the standard of living of the remaining population in subsequent years of better harvests was higher than with prior better harvests at higher populations.Destruction of productive capital was for most of agricultural history as common as creation of capital.   Causes included  high rents and taxes that forced  a choice between going hungry and consuming capital.  War (quartering and foraging of troops, destruction of enemy crops and livestock, etc.) was a frequent cause of capital destruction.    Some kinds of capital, e.g. livestock and the fertility of the soil, could be destroyed simply by being neglected.  Mancur Olson distinguished between societies of “roving bandits”, where nomadic rulers stole the surpluses of foragers or farmers wherever they went, and “stationary bandits”, who controlled a specific area and simply taxed that area.   Rational stationary bandits taxed only to the Laffer maximum, because any further taxation actually reduced their revenues.   Indeed, because over-taxation resulted in the destruction of capital, a secure rational stationary bandit reduced taxes below the short-term Laffer maximum to prevent lower tax revenues in future years.  Roving bandits, on the other hand, stole nearly all, resulting in destruction of nearly all capital, because anything insecure that one roving bandit didsn't steal was stolen by another. Stationary bandits did not always confine themselves to taxation that resulted in no destruction of capital.  Uncertainty over future power could cause a leader to get greedy and tax at capital-destroying levels while they were still in power.  Threats of assasination, coup, or conquest could move stationary bandits closer to roving bandits, since the bandits lost their future revenues if they lost power or territory: in such cases they rationally taxed far higher than the Laffer maximum, usually destroying much capital in the process.As a result, we can characterize societies and locate their isoclines based on their mode of banditry.  This often gets confused with the mobility of production, and the two usually coincided, but they could and often were distinct.   Thus most pastoral societies, based on moving livestock from pasture to pasture, also featured roving banditry.    And societies based on fixed arable agriculture were generally controlled by stationary bandits.  But early modern Britain was a semi-pastoral society but with stationary bandits.   And Dark Ages Europe featured roving bandits from pastoral societies frequently conquering arable societies, and being conquered in turn, resulting in a move to a lower-capital society with a mix of roving and stationary banditry.The Problem of Edible CapitalOf all the ways in which capital can be destroyed, the hardest to avoid, in a hard year, was eating it.   Eating your milk cow or your draft animal was like eating your seed corn: very unwise but very likely if your alternative was imminent starvation.The temptation to eat your capital created vicious cycles of capital destruction.   Capital destruction lowered labor productivity, which meant that people produced less calories per calories consumed.   This moved the Malthusian isoclines “southwest”, which meant even more people starved during the next equally bad year.  War and excessive taxation could trigger or extend the vicious cycle by killing livestock, poisoning farmland, etc.– and rendering future returns insecure, rendering further destruction of capital more probable.   The vicious cycle of capital consumption during times of famine may be the main factor that kept ancient agricultural civilizations mired in the Malthusian trap.Who owned the capital mattered.   Edible capital was much more likely to survive (and in the short term the starving people less likely to) if the capital was owned by people who were not themselves starving.   Thus, societies living under the feudal hierarchy of long-term tenancy, where livestock was often owned by the local lord rather than a peasant, many have maintained themselves farther above subsistence levels than societies where peasants completely controlled their own livestock.  Culture was filled with warnings against “eating your seed corn.”   Thus, as one example of many, Aesop’s stories of  “The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg.”   It was also filled with warnings about the importance of saving up for bad times, e.g. “The Ant and the Grasshopper.”Conversely, capital creation that increased labor productivity increased the calories produced per calories consumed, moving the Malthusian isocline up and right.  With storage of food it also freed labor for further capital creation, which in future equally good years in turn freed further labor for ancillary or non-agricultural capital investment (transportation, manufacturing, financial services, etc.).   However, for nearly all of agricultural history the vast majority of this surplus went to population growth, military expenditure, and luxury display rather than capital investment.   Thus, until the British breakout, agricultural societies remained in the Malthusian trap.   Prior agricultural socieities lacked an institutional ratchet that could incentivize capital creation in good harvests, but prevent too much capital destruction in bad harvests.   And they generally lacked low-cost protection from foreign wars, so that stationary bandits often started to act more like roving bandits when faced with threats of conquest.  To escape the trap, capital creation must exceed capital destruction to such an extent that farm labor productivity grows faster than population.  How Britain did this I hope to explore in future posts.
The pigeonhole principle sounds trivial but is profound. It says that you can't fit n pigeons into fewer than n holes without cramming at least two pigeons into one of the holes. It says that somebody must lose in a game of musical chairs. In fancier mathematese, which you can safely skip if it sounds like gibberish, the pigeonhole principle says that there is no bijective (or 1-to-1 and onto) mapping (or function) between a set S and any proper subset of S, or for that matter any set smaller than S. [*]The pigeonhole principle readily proves that there are people in Ohio with the same number of hairs on their head, that you can't eliminate the possibility of hash collisions when the set of possible input data is larger than the possible outputs, that if there are at least two people in a room then there must be at least two people in that room with the same number of cousins in the room, and that a lossless data compression algorithm must always make some files longer. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what the pigeonhole principle can help prove.First let's prove that if there are n people in the room, where n is at least two, then there must be at least two (but not necessarily n) people in that room with the same number of cousins (of the same degree or less) in the room. In mathematese (which you can again ignore if you wish) being a "cousin" a symmetric relationship (if I'm your cousin then you're mine) and non-reflexive (I'm not my own cousin). The proof actually works for any such relationship: twins separated at birth, members of the opposite sex, and so on. Here it is, another proof by contradiction:(1) Assume that each person in the room has a different number of cousins in the room;(2) Putting the pigeons in their holes, one person must have no cousins, and another one cousin, and so on; the nth person must have n-1 cousins. That fills up all the holes with no doubly-stuffed holes, right?(3) Yes, but if the nth person is a cousin with every other person in the room, then there can be nobody in the room with no cousins, so sequence (2) is an impossible contradiction, proving that in fact statement (1) is false: there must be at least two pigeons in the same hole, i.e. at least two people with the same number of cousins in the room.Next let's prove (again by contradiction) that any lossless compression algorithm must make some file larger:(1) Since it's a compression algorithm, by definition at least one file will be made shorter. Call the shortest such file F of size m which compresses to size n (i.e. n<m);(2) furthermore assume no file will be made longer;(3) thus every file of size n or less is incompressible;(4) since no files are made longer, thus there must be at least 2^n + 1 files that compress to size n or less: all files of size n or less plus file F;(5) but we can't fit 2^n + 1 pigeons into 2^n holes without putting two pigeons in one of the holes: in other words, at least two files must compress to the same output file, which is lossy compression;(6) thus assumption (2) is false: if the compression is lossless some file must be made longer.Lossless compression nevertheless can be quite effective because data is usually far from uniformly distributed among the 2^n possibilities. The most common patterns are given the shortest codes, resulting in overall compression in almost all real files that aren't already compressed, encrypted, or otherwise random.The proofs on hairs and hash collisions are left as exercises for the student.  (Don't you hate when math textbooks say that?)An old pigeon farm, back when people actually ate these nasty critters. Presumably all the pigeons fit into all the holes.[*] Update: this holds for finite sets; the technicalities are a bit different for infinite sets.  See comments.
For the purposes of estimating the value of a project, risk has for simplicity often been treated as spread out evenly over the life of a project.  For normal projects these risks can usually be fairly approximated by estimating risk per unit time.   This occurs in, for example, the net present value (NPV) formula for estimating the value of a project where a constant interest rate risk premium is used.  In a typical space mission, however, risk tends to be concentrated at particular events such as launches, burns, flybies and landings.  Just floating out in space is relatively quite low risk, which is why we can fly to Jupiter and Saturn with failure rates not significantly greater than missions to the moon or Mars.   All four of the spacecraft that have so far intentionally been flown beyond Saturn -- Pioneers 10 and 11, and Voyagers 1 and 2 -- had many initial glitches.  But since passing beyond Saturn they have travelled on for nearly two decades, far beyond Pluto, with no substantial and unexpected failure.  The Voyagers continue to send back valuable data on the very edge of the solar system, where the solar wind gives way to the interstellar influence -- more than 80 times as far from the sun as our own earth.There is a small risk of component failure that tends to obey a Poisson distribution that grows over time.   But the risk in even earth-orbiting satellites is dominated by launch and orbit-insertion failures, and other failures at the start of the satellite's lifetime, which are unrelated to the satellite's expected lifetime.  Thus the vast majority of the risk of most space projects does not grow exponentially with their duration, and indeed is usually not closely correlated to their duration in any way.  We would thus get an exponentially wrong answer by a line of reasoning that estimated the risk of a generic deep space mission as X%/year, and deduce by plugging that risk into the net present value (NPV) equation that, for example, an 8 year mission is substantially costlier (due to a risk that grows exponentially over time) than a 2 year mission.  An example of this fallacy is NPV analysis that assumes a constant risk premium for comparison of futuristic lunar and asteroid mining scenarios.   All such papers that I've seen (e.g. this one) fall victim to this fallacy.  To use NPV properly we need to account for the risks of particular events in the mission (in the mining scenario primarily launches, burns, and mining operations) to estimate a total risk, and divide that total risk by the duration of the mission to get a risk premium.   The risk premium per year for the longer mission will thus probably be substantially lower than for a shorter mission (implying an overall risk slighly higher for the longer mission, all other things being equal).   An even more accurate method for evaluating risk in space projects is called real options analysis.  It has changed valuation from the old static NPV model to a dynamic model based on specific risks.  One improvement this brings is removing the assumption of constant risk, which we've seen is wildly inappropriate for deep space missions.  Another idea real options brings us is that designing a project to postpone choices adds value to the project when there will be better information in the future.  A science mission example: if a scientific event could occur at either target A or target B, it's best to postpone the choice of target until we know where the event is going to occur.  If that's possible, we now have a scientifically more valuable mission.Orbital planning for deep space missions tends to plan for a fixed mission ahead of time.  Real options analysis says that the project gains value if we design in options to change the project's course in the future.  For orbital mechanics that means designing the trajectory to allow retargeting at certain windows, even at some cost of delta-v and time.  (Whether the tradeoff is worth it can be analyzed using real options mathematics, if we can make comparison estimates of different scientific targets using a common utilitarian scale).In the context of an Jupiter orbiter swinging by various Jovian moons, such options might include hanging around an interesting moon longer or changing the trajectory to target.  The idea is instead of plotting a single trajectory, you plot a tree of trajectories, with various points where the mission controllers can choose trajectory A or trajectory B based on mission opportunies.A shorthand way to think of real options analys is that the project is modeled as a  game tree with each node on the tree representing a choice (i.e. a real option) that can be made by the project managers.   The choices  are called "real options" because the math is the same as for financial options (game trees, Black-Scholes, etc.)  but they represent real-world choices, for example  the option of a vineyeard to sell its wine this year or let it age at least another year, the option of a mine to open or close, or expand  or shrink its operations, etc.The orbital planning I've seen tends to plan for a fixed mission ahead  of time.  Real options analysis says that the project may gain value  if we design in options to change the project's course in the future.   For orbital mechanics that means designing the trajectory to allow  retargeting at certain windows, even at some cost of delta-v and time.  (Whether the tradeoffs between delta-v, time, and particular real options are worth it can be analyzed using real options mathematics,  if we can compare different scientific targets using a common  utilitarian scale).In the context of the Jovian moons project, such options might include  hanging around Europa longer if a volcano is going there (like the one discovered on the similar moon Enceladus) or if some  evidence of life is found (or leaving it sooner if not), or changing  the trajectory so that the next target is Europa instead Ganymede if a volcano suddenly springs up on Europa, or to Io if an interesting volcano springs up there.  The idea is instead of  plotting a single trajectory, we plot a tree of trajectories, with  various points where the mission controllers can choose trajectory A  or trajectory B (sometimes with further options C, D, etc.) based on  mission opportunities.   Other trajectory options might include  hanging around a particular moon for longer or changing the view angle  to the target.   We may trade off extra delta-v, extra time, or both  in order to enable future changes in the trajectory plan. Here is more on real options analysis.  Real options analysis is also quite valuable for the research and developoment phase of a project.   Here is a good paper on real options analysis for space mission design.  My thanks to Shane Ross and Mark Sonter for their helpful comments on space project evaluation and planning.UPDATE: This post is featured in the Carnival of Space #22.
A common kind of mental transaction cost is demonstrated by psychological pricing, and in particular the strong tendency to price things at $(X-1).99 instead of $X.00.As Brian Moore points out, an extra digit is an easy visual way to filter out higher prices:If I see the following prices for gas:.99.981.02.89My brain immediately dismisses the 3rd price, then goes back and looks at the others to find the lowest  A seller doesn't want to be eliminated like that. Furthermore, we save on mental transaction costs by processing the more signicant digits first and often ignoring the rest.   That fits our habit of scanning numbers from left to right.
In the 19th century spectacular Jewish burial caches ("geniza"), totalling over 10,000 items, including over 7,000 documents, were unearthed in old Cairo. Study of these items has shed light on the status of commercial payments in Islamic society (and Jews living within it) before the development of full bills of exchange, deposit banking with loans, and so in 14th century Europe. The Muslim world connected that European world to the highly evolved ancient civilizations, almost unbroken from Sumer to Phoenicia and Persia to the Muslim Caliphate. At the time of the Geniza documents Muslim trading networks spanned much of the globe, from Indonesia to Spain.Among the finds dating from the Muslim zenith between the 10th and 12th centuries:Cases, or sealed purses containing a specific number of coins. These had been in use since at least ancient Phoenicia for paying with specific weights of gold or silver. A widely trusted entity (coin exchangers, government mint or treasury officers, or individual merhants) would deposit a specific weight and purity of jewelry or coins in the purse, and seal it. Cases relieved the recipient of having to weigh the coins, substituting trust in the sealer of the purse. Cases remained in common use with the onset of coinage, since coins wore out, depreciating below their face value, and merchants wanted payment by weight, not face value. A widely trusted entity (exchange or government officers, or individual merhants) would deposit a specific weight and purity of jewelry or coins in the purse, and seal it. In Europe cases were far less common. This may be due to less security on the road, or because many Italian and some German cities more frequently reminted worn coins than did the caliphate. In other parts of Europe where coin quality was poor, bank notes and bills of exchange later became the preferred medium of exchange. Cases are still used in modern diamond dealing to avoid tedious re-assaying of the diamonds.Suftaja, or demand notes at a distance. These were used, like the later European bills of exchange, to transfer money over long distances. Under Muslim law, a suftaja was a "loan of money in order to avoid the risk of transport." Suftaja had been in widespread use at least since ancient Persia. Unlike many bills of exchange, they were payable in coin (by weight) on demand rather than on a specific date. They cost a fixed fee rather than interest, although the fee could vary depending on the distance between cities without violating usury laws.Hawala, or an order to pay. This was similar to a modern check, but more cumbersome. Hawala was an order to a third party to pay the recipient in coin. In legal form, it was a delegation of a debt from the maker to the payer, and had to be made before a notary to verify the payer's assent.Three big differences between Muslim commercial payments at their zenith and the later European practices that gave birth to the industrial revolution and modern capitalism were:(1) The Muslims did not combine deposit banking with loans of deposits. One consequences was no market for commercial paper by which the ongoing costs of a business (especially wages and overhead) could be financed.(2) Perhaps related to (1), the lack of large commercial organizations such as the later Dutch and British India companies. For example, Arab trading ships , while common from the Mediterranean to Indonesia, tended to be owned by individuals.(3) Stricter enforcement of usury laws (perhaps also the cause of (1)). This was also a problem in Europe until the 14th century Genoese, among others, developed contracts based on bills of exchange that essentially mimicked loans with interest but without overtly charging interest. The saftaja and hawala by contrast were more rigid forms that could not be varied to hide interest without attracting the wrath of clerics.Despite the advances they later made, it's clear that Europe did not come up with their 14th century commercial innovations from scratch. Rather, Italy and the Hanseatic cities, and later the Dutch and the English, stood on the shoulders of giants -- on commercial practices, institutions, and techniques that had been evolving in the Middle East since the clay commercial documents of ancient Sumer.
In most political theories and ideologies, there is a preposterous oversimplification about what kinds of political relationships are desirable, common, or even possible. Given the irreduceable complexity of society, any summary of real-world political relationships is by necessity going to be greatly oversimplified, but most such movements neglect even very broad and common kinds of political relationships.  So herein, based on my extensive study of the legal relationships between political players that have existed in a very wide variety of polities, is a classification scheme:Let's define a "polity" as any entity with some coercive powers. Polities can range in scale from the United Nations to the jail cell at the back of your local shopping mall.  By studying polities over many years, and borrowing from previous work on law and political science, I have identified three basic kinds of legal relationships between polities. The basic legal structure, or constitution, of a polity can also be characterized by how much and in what ways it is composed of each kind of relationship. The three basic kinds of political relationships are:(1) Delegation: This includes any kind of delegation from a principal to an agent.  The principal authorizes the agent to act for him, e.g. by making a contract or treaty with a third party to which the principal will be bound. A principal can be a boss, a contractee, or voter; the corresponding agents being employee, contractor, or representative.  We can characterize principal/agent relationships by representation distance, with each extreme common:(A) at a very short representation distance is the master/servant (in modern parlance, employer/employee) relationship. The master gives orders to the servant who is delegated to carry them out and closely supervised. A military dictatorship, for example the Roman Empire, is or was dominated by commander-subordinate relationships.  In such a system, to paraphrase the legal code compiled for the Emperor Justinian, the emperor's will is law. (B) at the other extreme, an extremely long representation distance, is the relationship between millions of voters and the representatives they vote for in most modern governments.  Voters do not give orders, but rather are treated as having delegated most their coercive powers to their representatives.  Representatives in modern governments usually further delegate political and legal power to unelected bureaucracies themselves dominated by type A (boss/employee) relationships.(2) Subsidiarity: for example the relationship in the United States between counties and states, or between the states and the federal government. Often these combine supremacy clauses (when in conflict the law of the encompassing jurisdiction trumps that of its subsidiaries) with typically enumerated powers (the subject matters of the encompassing power is typically limited relative to that of the subsidiary). We can characterize subsidiarity relationships by how much and what kinds of coercive power can be exercised by the encompassing jurisdiction.In medieval England, the subject matter of the encompassing jurisdiction was very small, the Crown essentially having jurisdiction only regarding procedural laws for interactions between subsidiarity jurisdictions (which like the encompassing Crown were held as property by individuals or corporations), as well as some war-making powers. Substantive law was almost entirely in the hands of the encompassed jurisdictions, including the specialized merchant courts as peers enforced an international standard of business law, the lex mercatoria.By contrast in the modern U.S., the substantive legal jurisdiction of the encompassing power has become vast in scope.  Nevertheless one can still find many examples of fine-grained subsidiarity, down to "stand your ground" laws, citizen's arrest, and those shopping mall jail cells.In property law (which once was also procedural law and essential to defining political relationships), the landlord/tenant relationship is a subsidiarity relationship. The landlord is generally not the master of the tenant, and cannot issue the tenant arbitrary commands, but rather their relationship is governed on both sides by the constraints imposed by the tenancy.(3) Peer-to-peer: these include any agreements made between polities where neither is a subsidiary of the other, or a standard law arrived at in parallel, either through parallel development of precedent (as in the lex mercatoria and many other bodies of law) or codification of a standard law (e.g. the Uniform Commercial Code, which is not federal or national law, but a standard set of laws separately enacted by 50 separate jurisdictions, the states of the United States, as peers).  Peer-to-peer relationships most commonly involve maintaining distinct sets of laws adapted to local conditions along with agreements or mutually evolved practices for resolving conflicts of laws. Conflict-of-laws law itself was primarily developed through parallel development of judicial precedent, through courts respecting each other in order to maintain their reputations for enforcing the rule of law. On a larger scale wars and treaties between nations are peer-to-peer relationships. In medieval Italy, a wide variety city-states that were often at war with each other nevertheless also developed through this process most of the body of modern conflict-of-laws law.Since political theory developed in universities out of the study of Roman imperial law, it has been dominated by imputing to polities only one of the above kinds of relationships -- namely master/servant or commander/subordinate relationships, or at best delegation in general.  This is especially apparent in the quixotic search for a "locus of sovereignty", a search that typically amounts to conspiracy theory in search of a hidden commander-of-all when in fact far more sophisticated combinations of the above kinds of relationships are at play.For further reading:Conflict-of-laws lawSubstantive vs. procedural lawJurisdiction as property (subsidiarity and peer-to-peer relationships via property law)Representation distanceLiberty of house (common law origins of stand-your-ground laws)
Several years ago, before section 101 of the U.S. patent statute became fashionable again, I wrote a paper on it, "Elemental Subject Matter."    I remember several professors and patent attorneys, who shall remain nameless, telling me that section 101, which defines what kinds of subject matter are patentable and what kinds are not, was a useless topic to explore -- these issues, they said, had all been resolved and the legal excitement was elsewhere.  I thought otherwise.  I researched and in my paper I described the basic loophole that made software patents possible.   Algorithms are "laws of nature" or "abstract ideas" and as such are supposed to be unpatentable.  Patent lawyers being clever got around this by tacking on an extra fig-leaf or Christmas-ornament element to patent claims: the patent was for process X,Y,Z "and a computer", where X and Y and Z is the novel and non-obvious algorithm and "computer" is just your general-purpose computer.   Under a long line of high court precedents, starting with the old English case of Nielson v. Harford, and continuing through many Supreme Court cases, this was an invalid claim: {X,Y,Z}, the part of the patent that makes it novel and non-obvious, must itself be patentable subject matter, i.e. not just an algorithm or law of nature or abstract idea.   But the Federal Circuit, which hears all U.S. patent appeals and thus dominates U.S. patent law, ignored Nielson.  Software became patentable because lawyers could trivially tack on "computer" or "memory" onto software claims, turning abstract algorithms into patentable "machines." Still later, the Federal Circuit allowed even these fig-leafs to be dropped from software patents, they were implicitly understood.  The issue has never come before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Until now.At least four Supreme Court justices brought up the issue in Monday's oral arguments in Bilski v. Kappos, a business methods patent.  The main patent claim reads as follows:A method for managing the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider at a fixed price comprising the steps of:(a) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said consumer;(b) identifying market participants for said commodity having a counter-risk position to said consumers; and(c) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of said series of consumer transactions(Forget about the fact that this is not even novel much less non-obvious.  When the Federal Circuit allows claims to be made in areas where they previously weren't, the U.S. Patent Office agents are incompetent to analyze techniques in the new area or to search for prior art, and indeed a search of prior patents, which is almost all they know how to do, naturally turns up no prior art.  Thus the many preposterously obvious software and business method patents we've seen.  The case is being heard on the assumption that the patent office agent was correct, absurd as it is, to declare this claim novel and non-obvious, and the issue is thus focused on whether such business methods are patentable subject matter under section 101 of the patent code).These four justices seem to agree with the view of my paper that the Christmas ornament loophole lies at the heart of software and business method patents:JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand how that can be a patent on a machine if the only thing novel is the process that the machine is using. Isn't -- isn't the question -- really, the question there was whether the new process was patentable. (p. 42)(in reply to Justice Stevens repeating the above point)JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- that's a problem I have. (p. 44)JUSTICE BREYER: But then all we do is every example that I just gave, that I thought were examples that certainly would not be patented, you simply patent them. All you do is just have a set of instructions for saying how to set a computer to do it. Anyone can do that. Now, it's a machine.  So all the business patents are all right back in...all you do is you get somebody who knows computers, and you turn every business patent into a setting of switches on the machine because there are no businesses that don't use those machines.(p. 46)This is also what Chief Justice Roberts is clumsily getting at on pg. 35:CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ...that involves the most tangential and insignificant use of a machine. And yet you say that might be enough to take something from patentability to not patentable. I'd like to think that somebody over there in the Supreme Court building has been reading my paper, but more likely, yet remarkably, Justice John Paul Stevens, the author of Parker vs. Flook, the last case to apply Nielson v. Harford properly, and the only justice left from that 1977 court, still remembers Nielson and has taught a whole new generation of justices its meaning.The implications of this view may seem harshly radical (if you rely on software patents) or pleasantly reactionary (if you fondly remember the days when we didn't have them).   The patent bar and software patent holders have been in a tizzy since Monday, fearing that the Court's hostility to business method patents will lead to a ruling that will spill over to invalidate the recent non-ornamented software patents they have been drafting and the USPTO has negligently been approving.  And software engineers have been dreaming that they will finally be freed from some of the increasingly dense patent thicket.  But if the Court, as the above comments suggest, returns to Nielson, the result could be even more dramatic than is hoped or feared.  Taking the Nielson logic to its conclusion would invalidate practically all software-only and business method patents, including ornamented ones.  Those who want software patents would have to go do what they should have done in the first place -- get Congress to pass a statute expanding patentable subject matter to software, and very importantly command the USPTO to recruit and train computer scientists and people who know how to search the non-patent software literature for prior art so that software claims that don't make sense won't pass muster.  Then, if this experiment works, a few decades later try the same method for business patents.   And if the experiment doesn't work, scrap software patents.  At this point, the Federal Circuit's illegitimate experiment with software and business method patents is failing miserably.  Let's hope the Supreme Court takes this opportunity to restore its old patent jurisprudence that the Federal Circuit so shamelessly flouted.
Stephen Broadberry describes new estimates of per capita GDP which say that the economic divergence between Western Europe and other civilized parts of the world predates the industrial revolution.  (H/T Marginal Revolution).  This is more consistent with my own theories (linked below) than the idea that the Great Divergence magically appears from nowhere around the year 1800.  Nevertheless I feel compelled to point out shortcomings in these kinds of estimates, on any side of such debates.There are the usual correctable, but sadly seldom corrected, problems with datasets comparing European economies over historical periods, for example using "Holland", and leaving out, presumably not only the rest of the modern Netherlands, but the entire area of the exceptional Low Country late medieval industry and wealth (Flanders, Brabant, Hainault, etc.), most of which migrated (along with most of the skilled craftsmen and merchants) to the Netherlands during the 16th century wars there.  The southern Low Countries, until those wars, were the leading centers of European textile manufacture and probably also had the most labor-productive agriculture.Worse are these and all other attempts to compared historical European "wealth" or "income" to those of non-European cultures before the era of cheap global precious metals flows (initiated by the exploration explosion) allows comparison of prices.  How do you compare the “wealth” or “income” of rice-eating and cotton-wearing Chinese farmer to a milk-drinking, oat-eating, and wool-clad Scottish peasant? It it is neither very useful nor very reliable to try to reduce such cultural and even genetic differences to mere numerical estimates.So it's no surprise to see such conjectural and subjective estimates subject to major revisions, and I'm sure we'll see many more such revisions, in both directions, in the future. That said, many of the economically important innovations in northwestern Europe long predate not only the industrial revolution, but also the Black Death (Broadberry's new date for the start of the Great Divergence), including the following biological bundle:(1) heavy dairying(2) Co-evolution of human lactase persistence and cow milk proteins(2) delayed marriage(3) hay(4) greater use of draft animalsThese innovations all long predate the Black Death, except that thereafter this biological divergence, especially in the use of draft animals, accelerated.  After a brief interruption the lactase persistent core resumed its thousand-year conversion of draft power from humans and oxen to horses, including super-horses bred to benefit from good fodder crops -- the Shire Horse, Percheron, Belgian, etc., and of course the famous Clydesdale of the beer ads.  Draft horses figured prominently in the great expansion of the English coal mines from the 14th to 18th centuries. They both pumped the mines and transported the coal to navigable water.  Due to lack of horsepower for pumping and transport, the Chinese use of coal, though already well established by the 13th century visit of Marco Polo, where both mine and consumer were within short human-porter distance to navigable water, failed to grow beyond that limit until the coming of the railroad.  Similarly draft horses, alongside the more famous water-mills, played a key role in the early (pre-steam) exponential growth of the English textile industry, the economically dominant feature of the early industrial revolution.Greater use of draft animals led to higher labor productivity and larger markets for agricultural output, and thus to greater agricultural specialization. Higher labor productivity implies higher per capita income, even if it can’t be measured. For civilizations outside Western Europe by contrast, much less use was made of draft animals with the result that these effects were confined to within a dozen or less miles of navigable water.Contrariwise, northern Europe has always been at a severe ecological disadvantage to warmer climates when it comes to growing rice, cotton, sugar, and most other economically important crops.  However these seem not to have had an anti-Malthusian effect in increasing labor productivity -- the increased efficiency of rice in converting solar power to consumable calories, for example, simply led to a greater population rather than a sustained increase in per capita income.
Argument from authority ("I'm the expert") goes hand-in-hand with the ad hominem ("you're not"). Each may be rebutted by the other, and the average quality as evidence of arguments from authority are about the same as the average quality as evidence of ad hominem. By necessity, these two kinds of evidence are the dominant forms of evidence that lead each of us as individuals to believe what we believe, since little important of what you believe comes from your own direct observation. Authority's investment costs are one good proxy measure for evaluating the value of such evidence. But contrast the law of the dominant paradigm. Perhaps the latter is superior for judging claims about the objective world, whereas investment costs are superior for judging the intersubjective.
Will McCarthy's book Hacking Matter is now online. Although it contains too much hype for my tastes, it also contains a good layman's description of quantum dots (artificial atoms) and similar devices. See also the programmable matter FAQ.
Parts of the trend towards smart contracts are advances in vending machines. Indeed, a vending machine is a very ancient kind of smart contract, supposedly going all the way back to coin-operated holy water dispensers in Ptolemaic Egypt.Touch screens allow some newer vending machines to present a user interface like that of a web site or catalog, and newer robotic mechanisms allow the goods to be dispensed more carefully (and thus allow a wider variety of products to be dispensed). If you haven't yet used one of these newer machines here's a good video:It's important that the machine be as fair as possible to avoid either the vendor or the customer being cheated. But it's tricky. "[T]o prevent the thing snagging and you getting ripped off," Motorola's machine is designed so that "your card is only charged when the sensors detect you removing it from the bin."There's a flower-vending machine where you can either buy fresh flowers from the machine itself or order flowers sent somewhere.There's a machine that loans soccer balls. The user interface is your cell phone instead of on the machine itself. The balls are tagged with RFIDs, a primitive form of proplet, so that the machine can tell when you've stolen a ball (or at least when you've removed it out of the allowed area of use) rather than returned it. The machine also keeps a social register of soccer players to help you find somebody nearby to play with. This is moving us far from the traditional vending machine and towards a far wider variety of automated transactions heretofore enforced by contract or property law rather than computer protocol.Japan, as a low-crime and gadget-loving country, fields machines selling a wide variety of products and services. There's a refrigerated locker where you can store your groceries and continue shopping and a machine where farmers can put in money and polish their rice. Some machines take 10,000 yen notes (about $80). Some parking machines place bars under or in front of the car that prevent the car from being removed from the spot until the fee is paid.
Words like "rights," "freedoms", "liberties", "duties", and so on describe crucial ideas but are often used ambiguously in politics and the law.   Lawyer Wesley Hohfeld early in the twentieth century in the United States developed a classification and technical terminology for these ideas that goes far towards eliminating much of this ambiguity.   First Hohfeld defined these ideas as relationships between persons.   Second, he organized them into binary opposites and correlatives.   Here are the binary opposites -- you either have them or you don't:right/no-rightfreedom/duty(I'm substituting "freedom" where Hohfield and his followers have used "privilege" , "liberty", or even worse "permission" -- for reasons that should become apparent below).  With respect to a given subject matter and under a given set of laws governing that subject matter, you either have a right or no right, never both.  And you either have a freedom from duty or a duty, never both.The most crucial aspect of this terminology is that these ideas are also related as correlatives -- the existence of one implies the existence of the other.  Thusright of A => duty of (at least) Bfreedom of A => no-right of any otherHohfeld's terminology is often described (e.g. by the legal scholars Corbin and Singer) in terms of "the state" that whose enforcement actions create rights (and thus duties) and whose lack of enforcement action creates "privileges" or "permssions".  Regular readers of the blog will see at least one problem with this approach, but does Hohfeld terminology make sense independently of "the state"?  Not only do these terms make sense without "the state", they make even more sense without "the state" and even make sense independently of the existence of anything like a state.  Stateless scenarios help to illuminate the meanings of Hohfeld's terms, and getting rid of "the state" will shed light on analysis of the origins of rights.  For example, by distinguishing a "right" from a "freedom", I will create a much clearer description of John Locke's theory of a "social compact" which highlights some of its strengths and weaknesses.  This generalization of Hohfeld terminology also allows us to apply it to real world situations involving conflicting jurisdictions and laws rather than the mythological monolithic state.  Let's start with a Mr. Robinson Crusoe stranded alone on his tropical island.   Crusoe is able to do anything he likes without legal or other coercive restriction, or indeed without a negative response by another person of any kind -- he has perfect freedom.  But he can't sue or otherwise punish anybody, so he has, in Hohfeldian terms, no rights.   Robinson Crusoe expemplfies the correlatives "freedom" and "no right".  Now let's strand a Mr. Geoffrey Dalrymple on the island with Mr. Crusoe.   In a state of pure amorality and lawlessness (which is to be sure purely theoretical and in practice would not last for long), there are no rights of any kind.   Crusoe has no duties and thus perfect freedom to do anything (kill Dalrymple, steal his food, and so on), and correlatively Dalrymple has no rights.  Dalrymple for his part has no duties and thus perfect freedom, and and Crusoe has no rights.  Do we require a state to introduce rights into this situation?  In fact we don't even need the introduction of a third party.  To introduce rights and duties into this situation, Crusoe and Dalrymple merely need to enter into an agreement, a la Locke.   This agreement could be as informal as a common cultural understanding or as formal as carving words on stone.  Let's say Crusoe agrees not to commit a tort (battery, theft, etc.) against Dalrymple and Dalrymple agrees to not commit a tort against Crusoe.  Crusoe now has rights (defined by tort law as he understands it, unless stated explicitly) against Dalrymple and Dalrymple now has tort rights (defind by tort law as he understands it, unless stated explicitly) against Crusoe.   Crusoe correlatively has duties towards Dalrymple, and vice versa, and both correspondingly have their freedoms reduced.   They have traded some freedoms for some rights.  (This is a much clearer way of saying, in the older terminology in which "freedom", "rights", and so on were overlapping and often indistinct concepts, that people have traded away some rights in order to preserve other rights).Of course the consequences of a right -- in particular the remedy available for the breach of a right -- is hardly the same as in a mature legal system with courts, police, etc.  If one of Crusoe's rights is breached, for example by Dalrymple stealing his food, his only remedy is to take an action himself -- for example, steal back some food.   Crusoe and Dalrymple would be wise to specify such remedies in their agreement.  We can see how a third party, or even better courts and police, would help enforce such a remedy, but they, and much less "the state", are not necessary for the basic Hohfeldian ideas of right and duty to arise.Corbin, in describing Hohfeldian terms, invoked "a giant" as a metaphor for "the state."   It's easy to see that if a wise giant lived on the island it would be profitable for Crusoe and Dalrymple to agree to use that giant to hear their cases and enforce the remedy they had agreed upon.  This corresponds to the "choice of forum" clause found in many modern contracts.  But let's say there were two wise giants on the island, Giganticus and Gargantua.  This multiplicity of giants would certainly confuse Corbin's (and Singer's) explanations of Hohfeld, but is in fact readily explicable in Hohfeldian and choice-of-forum terms.  There are often great advantages to division of labor.   Crusoe and Dalrymple could thus agree to divide up the subject matters of their agreement.   They might, for example, choose Giganticus to adjudicate and enforce tort and property law, and Gargantua to adjudicate and enforce contract law (include this meta-contract).Alternatively, if Giganticus is strong and Gargantua is wise, they might agree that Gargantua should decide the cases regarding any subject matter (i.e. act as a judiciary) and Giganticus should enforce them (i.e. act as an executive).  As another alternative , the giants could agree on the division of subject matter jurisdiction betweem them, or divide between them adjudication and enforcement, and force their agreement on Crusoe and Dalrymple.  Each of these scenarios is a plausible one.  None involve "the state", but each involve rights and correlative duties as well as freedoms and correlative lack of rights. The probability that the giants would enforce their own brand of law, rather than just enforcing whatever Crusoe and Dalrymple agree to, casts some doubt on Locke and other "social contract" theorists as providing an actual history rather than an ideal of the formation of legal systems or states.  More likely is the model of Mancur Olson, in which "stationary bandits" out-competed "roving bandits" in the coercively competitive business of collecting taxes and thereby formed states (and, I'd add, formed other kinds of political property rights as well).  All fodder for future posts. Ref: Hohfeld, W. N. Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning, ed. by W.W. Cook (1919); reprint, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, (1964).UPDATE: I have clarified my recasting of Locke's analysis and corrected a typo pointed out by a commentor.
From my article, The God Protocols:Imagine the ideal protocol. It would have the most trustworthy third party imaginable — a deity who is on everybody's side. All the parties would send their input to this god. God would reliably determine the results and return the output. In addition, God, being the ultimate in confessional discretion, would ensure that no party would learn anything more about the other party's input than they could learn from their own input and the output.Alas, in our temporal world we deal with humans rather than deities. Yet, too often we are forced to treat people in a nearly god-like manner because our infrastructure lacks the security needed to protect ourselves.To an astonishing extent, network security theorists have recently solved this problem. They have developed protocols that create virtual machines between two or more parties. Multi-party secure computation allows any number of parties to share a computation, each learning only what can be inferred from their own input and the output of the computation. These virtual machines have the exciting property that each party's input is held in strict confidence from the other parties. The program and the output are shared by the parties. For example, we could run a spreadsheet across the Internet on this virtual computer. We would agree on a set of formulas and set up the virtual computer with these formulas. Each participant would have their own input cells, which remain blank on the other participants' computers. The participants share output cell(s). Each participant inputs their own private data into their input cells. Alice could only learn as much about the other participants' input cells as she could infer from her own inputs and outputs. I go on to briefly describe applications such as confidential auditing and auctions with private bids, here.Related articles: confidential auditing, secure time-stamping, advances in distributed security.Some outside links to papers: secure time-stamping, multiparty secure computation.
This blog has never before expressed an opinion about a specific political election.   Unenumerated takes a long view and electioneering is generally not the most effective means of political action.  Occasionally, however, there is a remarkable exception.  Ron Paul's candidacy for President of the United States is the most remarkable such exception of our era.Among the makeup-encrusted crop of TV-hyped politicians, Ron Paul stands alone in working, not to propagate mass media mythologies, but to preserve and restore our genuine freedoms and our highly evolved traditions.  Where other politicians go on and on about "freedom" in order to justify wars and suppressions that deprive people of their lives, liberties, and properties, Ron Paul throughout his long career has labored to preserve and restore our freedoms.   Ron Paul has worked to heal the wounds to liberty and the damages to our essential institutions that were inflicted by barbaric politics over the last century:  the wars, the ethnic cleansings, the nationalizations, and the corruptions that have worked in tandem to destroy many of the freedoms our forefathers held dear.   From property rights to privacy, the rights to bear arms and defend ourselves and our loved ones, rights to speak freely via technology old and new, rights to be free from false arrest and torture, the list of freedoms we once held but are now losing is long.   Without a libertarian surge, a rising of people to rebuke the evils of the century now thankfully over, the barbarity of that century will have become fixed as the only reality we know, and we will be plunged into a long dark age.Because Ron Paul is the only presidential candidate who puts a high priority on preserving and restoring property rights, the bedrock institution of modern economies, it is no surprise that he recently raised more money in a single day than any other person in U.S. political history.  Ron Paul is the only presidential candidate in touch both with our highly evolved past and our networked future.   He has moved beyond the mass-media prejudices that caused the twentieth century to march lock-step into genocidal wars and nationalization.  So it is no surprise that Ron Paul's main strength is on the Internet and his main weakness is in the mass media.Even if, as mass media polls currently imply, Ron Paul does not win the 2008 Republican nomination, his staying power and independence give him the potential to exert a libertarian influence on United States politics far beyond recent experience.   Even if he doesn't win a single state, Paul is demonstrating that he has a substantial and loyal following.  He will stay in the race to the very end, and Republicans will have to make valuable concessions to prevent him from becoming an independent candidate who would throw the election.   No one man can heal the many injuries that freedom has suffered, nor the many damages that have been done to our highly evolved institutions.  But Ron Paul's success will inspire many more lovers of our once and future liberties to step forward and make that future.United States politics is delicately balanced between the traditional poles of right and left and may only need a small shove to push it in the orthogonal libertarian direction.    This is particularly true with respect to the institution with the most impact on our freedoms: the Supreme Court.   If Paul falls short of becoming the Republican candidate I recommend to him that he request one or more Supreme Court nominees of his choice as the price of his support for the non-libertarian Republican candidate.   On  the Supreme Court there are four justices on the traditional left and four on the traditional right.  As a result the one moderate justice, Justice Kennedy, exerts an overwhelmingly disproportionate influence.   Four years of libertarian influence on the Presidency, with two or three seats on the Court up for grabs, could tilt the Court quite heavily towards a restoration of our libertarian Constitution, a restoration of life, liberty, and property rights in the United States.  Uniquely among mainstream politicians, Ron Paul thinks beyond mass media hype.  He remembers and cares about the basic institutions that have made the United States a bastion of world liberty for most of the last 231 years, and will make it a "Shining City on a Hill" again in the future if we work to make it so.   For those who love our once and future freedoms, now is the time to strike.   Work and vote to elect Ron Paul for President in 2008.
(This is an edited version of comments I made on Catallarchy, posted here for my readers)The Takings Clause reads, "…nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." This has always been interpreted by courts to forbid taking for anything other than a "public use," compensated or otherwise. One can summarize the reasons for this interpretation as follows:(1) It’s the common-sense way to interpret the clause in light of the rest of the Constitution (e.g. in light of the rest of the 5th Amendment, by the doctrine of enumerated powers, by the 9th and 10th Amendments, by the interpretation rule of smaller to greater, etc.)(2) Precedent: the Supreme Court has always interpreted it that way. The big dispute is not over this, but over what "public use" means. Alas, the preposterously broad Kelo definition of "public use" makes the complement category "private use" almost a nullity.I’d add that forbidding of takings for private use reflects what English common law and state practice (interpreting similar provisions in state constitutions) was at the time of ratification. The framers simply took it for granted, thus the poor wording.(The framers realized such dangers of misinterpretation generally, however, which is why we have the 9th and 10th Amendments: to prevent construing of poorly worded clauses against individual rights).There are also good policy reasons to forbid takings for private use, such as the public choice waste that arises when B lobbies officials to take A’s land for B’s use.Which brings us to why Kelo wasn't even close to an accurate opinion about the law. The "public use" in the 5th Amendment probably referred to Hale’s "public interest" doctrine, which when the 5th Amendment was ratified meant only functions involving either coercion or monopoly – for example a police station or courthouse, or the equivalent of taking a toll on the only bridge across a river. A franchise was, to quote a modern movie, a business that could legally make "an offer you can't refuse." It was as a result closely regulated under common law. The most common requirements were that it had to be open to the general public, that the service be well maintained, and that it was restricted to charging only "reasonable" tolls.It is thus unconstitutional to take private property for the use of any competitive enterprise (even if it’s run by government). There are almost surely also Due Process Clause restrictions to taking property, even for a coercive function or a monopoly, when that involves "taking from A to give to B" (to paraphrase Sir Edward Coke in the 17th century and Justice Samuel Chase in Calder v. Bull), and to take property such as a house or communications device used to exercise a fundamental right, as I describe here. But U.S. courts don’t recognize those rights either.Around the time of the ratification of the U.S constitution, state constitutions that specified language like the U.S. constitution, and generally under common law, forbad takings (compensated or not) for non-"public use." There are two somewhat different issues here, since there were two different interpretations of what was forbidden as not "public use." The first forbad a taking from A to give to B rather than to a government. The second (and I believe correct) approach forbad taking for the use of a competitive enterprise, i.e. an enterprise that did not under the old common law require a special patent-like property right called a "franchise." A franchise was required, per Hale, for a natural monopoly which charged a "toll." A franchise could also be a privately owned court or police force (these were common in England, and there were some private courts in some U.S. colonies, but these had largely disappeared in the U.S. by the time of the ratification). A franchise was required by common law to be open to the public and charge a "reasonable" toll, unlike a competitive enterprise which could charge the market rate.On the first interpretation(whether private property could be taken from A and given to B), the following claims in early Supreme Court majority opinions are a bit exagerated, but generally correct: "...a law that takes property from A. and gives it to B: It is against call reason and justice, for a people to entrust a Legislature with SUCH powers; and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that they have done it. The genius, the nature, and the spirit, of our State Governments, amount to a prohibition of such acts of legislation." Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 388 (1798)"We know of no case, in which a legislative act to transfer the property of A. to B. without his consent, has ever been held a constitutional exercise of legislative power in any state in the union. On the contrary, it has been constantly resisted as inconsistent with just principles, by every judicial tribunal in which it has been attempted to be enforced.... The counsel for the plaintiffs have themselves admitted that they cannot contend for any such doctrine." Wilkinson v. Leland, 27 U.S. 627, 658 (1829)On the second interpretation(whether private property could be taken for a competitive enterprise instead of a franchise) the evidence is more concrete, but misunderstood, since hardly anybody understands franchise law these days. Justice Thomas' dissent in Kelo [with my comments in brackets] gives a good overview of the case law at the time: States employed the eminent domain power to provide quintessentially public goods, such as public roads, toll roads, ferries, canals, railroads, and public parks [all of these were, if privately held, franchises under common law -- NS]. Though use of the eminent domain power was sparse at the time of the founding, many States did have so-called Mill Acts, which authorized the owners of grist mills operated by water power to flood upstream lands with the payment of compensation to the upstream landowner. Those early grist mills “were regu­lated by law and compelled to serve the public for a stipu­lated toll and in regular order,” and therefore were actu­ally used by the public.They were common carriers— quasi-public entities. [These were toll-taking franchises -- NS] These were “public uses” in the fullest sense of the word, because the public could legally use and benefit from them equally. See Public Use Limi­tations 903 (common-carrier status traditionally afforded to “private beneficiaries of a state franchise or another form of state monopoly, or to companies that operated inconditions of natural monopoly”). Thomas cites many state cases where full public access was required, or else the taking prohibited. This however is an incomplete distinction: public access was merely required of a franchise by the common law, but there were other common requirements, such as the "reasonable toll" requirement, and these requirements didn't define a franchise. A franchise was defined per Hale as a business that its "customers" could not avoid using: either a coercive process, as tax farming or operating a private court, or a natural monopoly, i.e. an unavoidable service that charged a toll. To be sure, some early state legislatures tested the limits of their state-law eminent domain power. Some States enacted statutes allowing the taking of property for the purpose of building private roads [franchises were privately owned, so this is no exception to the rule -- NS]. These statutes were mixed; some required the pri­vate landowner to keep the road open to the public, and others did not. Later in the 19th century, moreover, the Mill Acts were employed to grant rights to private manufacturing plants, in additionto grist mills that had common-carrier duties. [citations omitted]
Laches is the common-law name for the concept more commonly known as "the statute of limitations."[*]  The idea is that, if a wrong has been done, or there is otherwise a dispute, we put a limit on the time within which the victim or the victim's estate can file charges or sue for damages.  Laches or statutes of limitations apply to practically all kinds of wrongs of any nature.   There are three strong reasons for setting time limits on redressing wrongs:(1) Memories fade, witnesses die, and evidence is degraded or destroyed, rendering the rights and wrongs of the case increasingly uncertain and susceptible to biased propaganda.(2) Security, confidence in, and stability of legal rights are crucial to a civilized legal system.  But if we go back far enough, the "chain of title" for almost every legal right we have (including our political as well as economic rights) can be plausibly argued to be illegitimate due to some kind of unredressed wrong: some commission of force or fraud that was never remedied.   Without a time limit, hardly any legal right of almost any kind could be held with legal security.(3) Having the estate of one person be responsible to the estate of another person for a wrong committed by the ancestor of one to the ancestor of the other gets us too far away from the individual responsibility and the shaping of behavior through incentives that is at the core of law.Laches should also be a core political principle.  Allowing some classes of citizens to extract "reparations" from other classes of citizens for harms done by some or many of the ancestors of members of one class to some or many of the ancestors of another class, without setting any time limits, renders the legal rights of all persons insecure.   Evaluations of ancient wrongs are susceptible to very distorted propaganda.  Punishments of individuals who did not commit the wrongs do not deter the recurrence of such wrongs in the future, and indeed are themselves wrongs that foster further resentment and breed more future claims for redress.  The moral imperative holding the members of one very imperfectly defined class, rather than persons who actually committed the wrongs, for the wrongs committed to some of the members or ancestors of another class, already doubtful, becomes increasingly doubtful as time goes by, as does the power of such laws or other political acts to shape behavior to desirable ends through incentives. [*]  Technically, the term "statute of limitations" applies where a statute expressly sets a time limit, and the doctrine of laches applies where no such statute exists.
A new crop of web services  in the U.K. allow you to locate and track people via their mobile phone.   The phone companies themselves, and emergency call centers, and anybody else authorized, have long been able to do this in the U.S. and U.K. and elsewhere, but now it's going retail.  There is also this service which at least alerts the trackee when his or her location is being queried.  This partially addresses the attack of borrowing somebody's phone long enough to "give consent" and then tracking them with the service.  Via Ian Grigg's Financial Cryptopgraphy.Counter-intuitively, this development may enhance privacy, since the publicity that accompanies retail services will help prevent people from being in denial about the functions of their cell phone.  Even if it doesn't enhance privacy in this manner, it may at least help take us from an Orwellian model of surveillance (the state behind a one-way mirror) to a Brinian model (peer to peer surveillance).    OTOH, it may just fulfill the daydream of many a boss of being able to track employees 24x7.

Perhaps the most underrated invention in history is the humble hourglass.  Invented in Europe during the late 13th or early 14th century, the sand glass complemented a nearly simultaneous invention, the mechanical clock.  The mechanical clock with its bell was a centralized way of broadcasting the hours day and night; the sand glass was a portable way of measuring shorter periods of time.  These clocks were made using very different and independent techniques, but their complementarity function led to their emergence at the same time and place in history, late medieval Europe.The sandglass was more portable than a water clock. Since its rate of flow is independent of the depth of the upper reservoir, it was also more accurate.  And, important in northern Europe, it didn't freeze in winter.An advancing technology in 13th century western Europe very different from mechanics was glass-blowing.    The origin of the sandglass is quite obscure, but its accuracy relies on a precise ratio between the neck width and the grain diameter. It thus required extensive trial and error for glass-blowers to arrive at hour glasses for sand, ground marble, eggshell, and other sized grains, and techniques for mass producing these precisely sized works of glass, besides a ready of market of users, which Europe turned out to be.There are no demonstrated cases of sandglasses before the 14th century. Manufacture and use of the sand-glass was widespread in western Europe by the middle of the 14th century. In 1339 Ambrosio Lorenzetti painted a fresco in Siena, one of the commercial cities of northern Italy, which shows a sandglass as an allegory for temperance (self-control).   Mariners in the Mediterranean were likely using sandglasses to measure time and velocity by 1313. By 1394 French housewives were using recipes to make, along with food, glue, ink, and so on, marble grains for an hour-glass:"Take the grease which comes from the sawdust of marble when those great tombs of black marble be sawn, then boil it well in wine like a piece of meat and skim it, and then set it out to dry in the sun; and boil, skim and dry nine times; and thus it will be good." Such a recipe presumably creates grains of a size in a precise ratio to a standard hour-glass neck size, thus producing an accurate time.The sandglass, not the mechanical clock, became between the 13th and 16th centuries the main European timekeeper in activities as diverse as public meetings, sermons, and academic lectures.  It was also the main navigational and scientific clock during that period. [*]From the point of view of later engineers, the mechanical clock was the more important invention -- they were on the cutting edge of technology from the time of their invention until the industrial revolution.  However,For contemporaries....the sandglass was equally or more important.   Until the widespread use of small table-top mechanical clocks, the sandglass was the primary means of fair timekeeping.    The sand glass was visible to all in a room, and it could only be dramatically and obviously “reset”, it couldn’t be fudged like a mechanical clock.   [*]As I detail here,  the sand glass also played an essential role in the technique of dead reckoning for ocean navigation, also developed in late medieval Europe.  A strict regimen of turning the glasses was kept non-stop throughout a voyage:During the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan around the globe, his vessels kept 18 hourglasses per ship. It was the job of a ship's page to turn the hourglasses and thus provide the times for the ship's log. Noon was the reference time for navigation, which did not depend on the glass, as the sun would be at its zenith.[8] More than one hourglass was sometimes fixed in a frame, each with a different running time, for example 1 hour, 45 minutes, 30 minutes, and 15 minutes. [*]Arab and Chinese navigators lacked this crucial piece, and thus by the time of the exploration explosion had not developed navigation techniques that could rival those of Western Europe.
Modern legal commentators often refer to property rights as "mere economic rights." Epstein and others have argued against a strong distinction between economic and personal rights. This article argues that some kinds and aspects of property rights, especially those associated with owning, renting, or providing a residence, a communications service, or an article or servcie associated with a family or other intimate relationship, are much more than economic rights. Besides possibly falling under the Takings Clause, these property rights also fall under the Due Process Clause, the First or Fourth Amendments, or other constitutional rights depending on the nature of the property. Such property rights cannot consistently with the Constitution be taken merely by monetary compensation, even if taken for a public use, but may be taken or unduly burdened by regulation only if they are forfeit due to lawbreaking of the property owner or if a full and complete equivalent to the violated right is provided.Although property law is commonly considered a branch of substantive rather than procedural law, this is a highly misleading categorization for the purposes of constitutional interpretation. Traditionally, obligations and rights associated with residence and property were at the core of common law procedural rights. "Due process" was and is considered synonymous with "the law of the land." "The law of the land" was guaranteed by the Magna Carta. Several state constitutions still protect "the law of the land" rather than "due process", but courts have always considered them to be synonymous. "The law of the land," under traditional common law, referred to core righs of property, person, and procedure that could be pled in the king's courts using the extraordinary writs, particularly quo warranto, habeus corpus, and prohibition. Quo warranto could not be used to take certain property rights unless those rights had been abused in violation of law and unless proper legal procedure was observed, just as under habeus corpus a person could not be imprisoned unless he or she was a lawbreaker and proper procedure was observed. Indeed the phrase "common law" originally referred, not to the "judge made law" of the king's courts generally, but only to that subset of the law that the king's courts could apply, via the extraordinary writs, in all parts of the land including against the many private (franchise) and Church courts. This is also the cf core meaning of "the law of the land" and "due process."So much did the Framers of the United States Constitution considered property to be the core and paradigmatic constitutional right that they often (as in this essay) referred to intangible rights such as freedom of speech, association, belief as property rights in order to afford them greater protection. The Framers did not make a sharp distinction between property and other rights, and they certainly did not dismiss property rights as "merely economic."These core common law rights could not be taken by mere compensation, but only due to illegal behavior by the rightsholder that forfeited the property right under law. Although these rights often referred to jurisdictional rights no longer recognized today, they also referred to rights that still have modern forms, such as "view of frankpledge," a local private police force whose modern forms include neighborhood watch programs and other community groups, "advowson", associated with community religious practice, and various rights to take action against people breaking the law on one's property or within one's residence, such as liberty of the house, with modern equivalents in "stand your ground" and other self-defense laws as well as Fourth Amendment rights restricting searches of residences and other property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.Although many of these rights associated with residence, community, and jurisdiction now take a very different form, Due Process rights still include rights to build relationships with one's neighbors and community for safety, security, religion and other purposes that are more than economic. Then as now, personal jurisdiction was based on the location of one's residence. At the core of these rights is the right to live in the residence and neighborhood itself. Due Process rights also include special rights of safety, security, privacy, and self-defense within one's own residence. A regulation or property taking that does not provide a full substitute for such rights, rather than mere monetary compensation, and whether for public use or otherwise, violates core Due Process rights.When jurisdiction, search and seizure rights, and rights of self-defense, among many other procedural rights, are based on property, a taking of that property, or a regulation that impacts such a right, may be a violation of Due Process rights. If so, the taking or regulation may not be accomplished by mere compensation. Rather, when Due Process rights are associated with property, this either poses an absolute bar to government action or requires a full substitution of the specific rights violated.Furthermore, the rights of privacy, recognized as protected by Due Process Clause, are often associated with residence. As Justice Kennedy wrote in Lawrence v. Texas:Liberty [under the Due Process Clause] protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places...This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects. It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.The home itself is often another important element of family and other intimate relationships. When property is associated with personal relationships, intimate behavior, the expression of personal beliefs, or the protection of one's safety and privacy, it takes on special constitutional meaning and is entitled to greater constitutional protection. Many common individual rights enforced against the government inherently include property rights and freedom of contract (rights of property in motion). For example, the right to birth control and abortion includes the property rights to own birth control and abortion clinics and the freedom of contract to buy and sell birth control devices and abortion services. Freedom of the press includes the right to own a newspaper, to buy and sell newspapers on one's own terms, to hire journalists and editors and control their work, to contribute to political campaigns, and to spend money on political compaigns. Similarly, the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process Clause should include the property rights associated with those rights, such as property rights to the protected home, curtilage, and other areas with a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. A taking or regulation of such areas should require the government to provide equivalent privacy and security functions of buildings and other features, or be barred altogether from the regulation or taking, rather than mere monetary compensation, even when taken for a public use. Many constitutional rights have at their core rights of property and property in motion (contract) that are entitled to enhanced protection since they are not "merely" economic rights.
Alex Taberrok writes about a wonderful decision out of the D.C. Circuit. The court basically held that the FDA is violating the Fifth Amendment (and I'd add, natural and common law) rights to life and liberty of terminally ill patients by preventing them from getting drugs for their purpose of saving their lives unless the FDA has a compelling interest in doing so that outweighs these rights. Amazingly enough, up until this court's decision one had a Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to terminate the life of a fetus (a right with which I agree) by getting an abortion (or taking an abortion pill) without the government placing an "undue burden" on these medical procedures, but no such right under United States law to try to save one's own life with relatively safe medication.Here's the court's opinion. I find the court's argument quite compelling, as it's based on both liberty and life, rather than just pitting one against the other as in the abortion debate. Alas, despite the compelling argument this doctrine may have a tough time surviving our current legal positivist (statutory language can do no wrong, and neither can regulation...) Supreme Court, not to mention a political environment where most of the planet thinks that medicine should be centrally planned by state bureaucrats, the patients be damned.
If you're a fan of court TV, or a lawyer, or enjoy seeing lawyers tormented, you might enjoy these bits of courtroom dialog, or at least be a bit disturbed. Here's a news story about the incident. For the best part of the dialog, though, you gotta watch the video. If your browser doesn't support the video directly, here is part 1 and here is part 2.
For Associate Justice of the Supreme Court I recommend that President Bush nominate Judge Janice Rogers Brown, formerly a justice on the California Supreme Court and currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Alternatively I would recommend Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
More good comments on the monstrous legislation from Jack Balkin, Jack Balkin, and Glenn Greenwald. The best comments are from a bunch of law professors, who attach the text of the Senate bill. I am no Democrat, but I couldn't agree more with Greenwald that our most urgent and important tasks here in the U.S. this fall are to end one-party rule of the federal government and to punish politicians who have voted away our freedoms. Toward that end here is the list of Representatives who voted for and against arbitrary detainment. See my prior post to determine how your Senators voted.Per Balkin's comments, and the comments of many who supported this legislation, an individual right of action in court -- i.e. habeas corpus -- has for many hundreds of years been the first line of defense against illegal imprisonment. Often it the only way for a prisoner to make his case heard. Without a right of action in court, any and all of the Bill of Rights, the Geneva Convention, and so on are just theoretical. That the a member of the executive branch would be doing something illegal by detaining innocents indefinitely, committing torture, and so on is moot unless it leads to impeachment or a court hearing. The possibility of impeachment, extremely unlikely even if the Democrats win in November, and no matter how many illegal acts the executive branch adds to the probable thousands it has already recently committed, is no substitute for the right of a person to defend his or her own rights in court. Furthermore, even if the President were impeached this would be not nearly enough to disincentivize the failure of much of the rest of the executive branch, as the Constitution commands them, to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." The fate of a short-term denizen of the White House is not that big a deal to a career bureaucrat who is doing the immediate law breaking. Faithful law enforcement depends crucially on the ability of the targets of that enforcement to defend themselves in court.
The spate of anti-phishing bills currently making their way into or through legislative bodies around the world provide a good opportunity to do something that is long overdue -- amend our obsolete and destructive cybercrime statutes.   If network security professionals are to be empowered to stop phishing and prevent cyberterrorism, a major overhaul to these statutes is crucial.The Cuthbert case in the U.K. has provided yet another example of an unjust conviction under cybercrime statutes.  These statutes were typically enacted before the advent of the Web and generally make "unauthorized access" to a computer a crime.  Under these statutes, the Web equivalent of pushing on the door of a grocery store to see if it's still open has been made a crime.  These vague and overly broad statutes put security professionals and other curious web users at risk.  We depend on network security professionals to protect us from cyberterrorism, phishing, and many other on-line threats.  These statutes, as currently worded and applied, threaten them with career ruin for carrying out their jobs.  Cuthbert was convicted for attempting to determine whether a web site that looked like British Telecom's payment site was actually a phishing site, by adding just the characters "../.." to the BT site's URL.  If we are to defeat phishing and prevent cyberterrorism, we need more curious and public-spirited people like Cuthbert.Meanwhile, these statutes generally require "knowledge" that the access was "unauthorized."  It is thus crucial for your future liberty and career that, if you suspect that you are suspected of any sort of "unauthorized access," take advantage of your Miranda (hopefully you have some similar right if you are overseas) right to remain silent.  This is a very sad thing to have to recommend to network security professionals, because the world loses a great deal of security when security professionals can no longer speak frankly to law-enforcement authorities.  But until the law is fixed you are a complete idiot if you flap your lips. Since almost any online activity of which, it turns out, the web site operator does not approve may be deemed to be "unauthorized," these cases revolve around whether the defendant "knew" that the act was "unauthorized."  In Cuthbert's case, because he told the police that his purpose had been to test the public site's access controls (the equivalent of pushing on doors of a grocery store to see if it is open) to see if he had just given his credit card number to a phishing site -- a laudable act of due diligence in this age of phishing and identity theft -- he essentially admitted to the difficult knowledge element of the criminal statute.  After that, the conviction was a slam dunk.Several years ago, network security professional Randall Schwartz engaged in  a traditional friendly competition with security professionals in another company to try to find holes in their security.  That company turned out to be not so friendly and Schwartz was convicted under an Oregon statute similar to the one that felled Cuthbert.  The court rejected  a defense of unconstitutional vaguenessbecause, said the court, it sounded more like a defense of overbreadth.  In fact these statutes are both vague and overbroad, but courts often do not understand the issues involved.Orin Kerr (a professor at my law school) has written a good paper on the subject with respect to laws in the United States.Kerr recommends using more specific language instead of "unauthorized access."  My own recommendation is that, if we are going to keep the "unauthorized access" language, it at least should be amended along the following lines: (1) an access should not be defined as "unauthorized" unless either the defendant was provided notice of lack of authorization (equivalent to a no-trespassing sign) and affordance (a barrier that requires some intentional act to pass, equivalent to a fence or a door), or there is a long-standing and widely-known custom that the kind of access as perceived by the defendant was unauthorized, or both, and(2) there should be no crime unless there was an underlying intent to use the unauthorized access to commit another kind of crime (such as theft of data, trespassing via disruption of computer operation, etc.) Under (1), "unauthorized access" would for the first time have a clear definition, similar to how "trespassing" is defined in the context of a public place (you are authorized to enter a public store when it is opened, to push on the door to see if the store is open, to shop, in some jurisdictions to use the restroom unless there is a sign to the contrary; but you are not to enter the back room where they have the safe).  Security professionals would operate under the same rules as everybody else instead of having knowledge discriminatorily imputed to them because they are "supposed to know better."Under (2), accesses done for laudable purposes, such as Cuthbert's investigation about whether his credit card had been phished, would no longer be considered criminal.  Network security professionals would be freed to do their jobs and protect the Internet from real criminals.The current spate of anti-phishing bills currently making their way into or through legislative bodies around the world provide a good opportunity to amend cybercrime statutes -- to bring them into the twenty-first century world of the public web.
(I recently rediscovered this old post of mine and thought it deserved re-posting).Paraphrasing Robin Hanson from a recent podcast: "In gifts, it's common signals of quality that matter, not private signals of quality."Robin Hanson has a great theory for why neoclassical economics so often fails to explain human relationships and institutions, especially personal relationships.  Why, he asks for example, do guests bring wine to dinner at an acquaintance's home instead of paying cash, like they would at a restaurant?  Traditional economics cannot explain such basic things.Instead Robin posits, building on the work of previous economists and evolutionary psychologists, that signaling dominates most of our relationships and many of our institutions.   In other words, much of our behavior is used to signal, or prove by our behavior, to our fellows our intelligence, empathy, status, and so on.  In the hunter-gatherer environments in which our genes evolved, such relationships were far more impportant to our genetic success than any other aspects of our environment.  Thus our behaviors are dominated by the signals that would have most advantageously (for our genes) developed our relationships in that environment.The general theory is sound -- I've held a version of it for quite a long time -- but many of the conclusions he draws from this theory, such as the above quote about gifts, are quite questionable.  The thoughtful gift, namely the gift that is targeted towards the recipient's unique preferences, is widely welcomed as the best kind of gift.  "It's the thought that counts" may be a cliche and an exaggeration, but it nevertheless carries substantial truth.   The thoughtful gift signals our intelligence, our empathy, and the fact that those skills are being used in favor of the gift recipient.This (and a second theory described below) explains far better than Robin does why cash makes such a bad gift.  A gift or exchange like bringing wine to dinner provides the opportunity to signal that one has remembered the dinner menu, and often also signals that one knows the hosts' wine preferences.  Cash by sharp contrast is the most thoughtless gift.  Cash is suitable only for contractual dealings with strangers; it is worse than useless for developing relationships.   Gift cards exhibit a modicum more empathy than cash (you have to know your pal likes Starbucks), but prior generations who put more effort into relationships considered gift certificates to be rather rude as a personal gift: they were only considered suitable as, for example, a substitute for a cash wage bonus. Today, like "friends" links on Facebook, gift cards signal a modicum of passing fancy which substitutes for the many closer relationships and more thoughtful gifts that most of our forebears enjoyed.A second reason that cash makes such a poor gift is that it provides a very poor emotional and sensory experience.  Most signals, as at least indirect products of evolution, are targeted at our emotions far more than they are targeted at  the intellect.   A good wine, for example, will be experienced far more fondly and thus remembered far longer than a dirty dollar bill.  The most common signals also tend to signal emotional states or skills (e.g. empathy) far more than intellectual ones.Per Friedrich Hayek, this emotional infrastructure breaks down when we are dealing with strangers -- in those cases contractual relationships and "filthy lucre" are far more efficient and effective ways of relating.  But the cold natures of these transactions, i.e. the fact that these relationships are divorced from the emotional signals evolution has wired us to expect, explains much of the political resistance to markets with their "filthy lucre", "greed", etc.  Merchants, property, contracts, and so on are crucial to our modern economy, but they send the wrong emotional signals to our hunter-gatherer brains.Most politics, and in particular the pathologies of politics, are themselves about instinctive signaling -- for example signaling tribal loyalty on the right, or signaling altruistic natures on the left.  Most political ideologies freely and fraudulently ignore the crucial distinction between friend and stranger: in the world of political signaling we are supposed to care as much about the vast anonymous "poor" as we do about our own children who we well know to be helpless, and we are supposed to be loyal to a vast country of hundreds of millions of strangers (including more than a few very strange strangers) as if they were all familiar kin.  In both cases, these are largely fake signals that don't cost the fraudulent signaler very much: the right-winger does not actually have to be patriotic, and the left-winger does not actually have to be altruistic, and in both cases they usually are not.  Few of the children of hawk Congressmen served in the Iraq War, and Barack Obama has given only a miniscule portion of his income to charity.   But they are very good at making the politically correct noises that most humans emotionally expect to hear.  Thus left-wingers can get great social mileage from calling right-wingers "greedy", meaning that right-wingers are failing to send enough altruistic signals, and right-wingers can get great social mileage from calling left-wingers "unpatriotic."  People who, due to real altruism, care more about the actual consequences of political policies than about sending the proper social signals to their peers, usually end up being called both "greedy" and "unpatriotic" in the bargain.
 Richard Parker lives in a small Philippine fishing village. He has extensively studied contemporary seashore foraging, fishing, and bead-making, and has thought and written quite a bit about prehistoric versions of same. Parker riffs on my theory of the origins of money, adding many interesting observations he's made about shells and bead-making along the way. He has some good comments about the debate over whether the older finds were actually beads or the puncture holes were just a result of the way they ate snails. Although he questions the rush of archaeologists to conclude that they were beads rather than worked prey, he concludes that Nassarius, at least, was too small for eating. Piercing them and sucking out the contents would presumably have been more trouble than it was worth.  Archaeologists recently discovered similar punctured Nassarius shells in Algeria and Israel that date back to 90,000 to 100,000 or more B.P.
I recently wrote about how the ability of Japan and Britain to defend their farmlands from foreign invaders, via their island positions and strong navies, were probably not unrelated to their having among the highest farm productivities between medieval and early modern times, despite unfavorable soils and climates.A similar phenomena occurred for commerce in commodities (including agricultural commodities after being harvested).  However, here the optimal scales of defense are much smaller since stores of commodities, along with the persons who produce, deal in, and consume those commodities, require far  less space than farmland. Thus during many eras cities were independently defensible areas.  In late medieval Europe cities became so independently defensible and had such different laws (specialized for commerce in commodities instead of agriculture) that they often became politically independent.  Indeed, four of the most successful medieval empires, Venice, Genoa, the Lombard League, and the Hanseatic League, were either centered on such cities or were an alliance of such cities.Several medieval areas especially benefitted from small defensible areas.  See, for example, this nice satellite image of Venice.    (There have been some small changes since the Middle Ages -- some of what is now ocean was once swamp land).  From their small island base, Venice was able to withstand the various Dark Age invasions and become a Mediterranean superpower.  Low Country cities such as Bruges, Ghent, and Amsterdam were surrounded and criss-crossed by canals such as this one in Bruges.Canals and oceanside locations also extended the reach of shipment for commodities.  Adam Smith estimated that water transport was about out twenty times cheaper by water than by the same distance on land.
I come up with far more ideas than I have time to properly evaluate, much less pursue. Long ago I worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and I still occasionally daydream about space stuff.   Recently there have been several proposals for shading the earth from the sun, put forth to combat global warming.   I've been noodling on my own sunshade idea for several years.  For your entertainment (and who knows, it might also turn out to be quite useful) here it is:Put a bunch of Venetian blinds at a spot permanently between the earth and the sun (know to orbital engineers as the first earth-sun Lagrange point, a.k.a. "L1"). These blinds would be refractive rather than reflective to minimize the stationkeeping needed to prevent being "blown" away by the pressure of sunlight. At L1 they only need to refract the light by less than one degree of angle for the light to miss the earth. Less than 2% of sunlight needs to be deflected away from earth to offset the expected global warming from "greenhouse gases," primarily carbon dioxide.Venetian blinds, unlike this proposal, and this one, can be opened or closed to allow continued control over the amount of sunlight hitting earth. This is essential since we can't really predict with great accuracy the degrees of global warming that we will need to combat. The blinds I propose, rather than being a number of joined slats as in a normal Venetian blind, are simply a large number of separate satellites each with a refractive slat that can be manuevered to any angle with the sun (i.e. from fully "closed" vertical to fully "open" horizontal).I propose that the blinds be placed precisely at the region where they will deflect primarily light headed for equatorial regions on earth. That will even out temperatures a bit between northern and equatorial latitudes and reduce the energy (caused by temperature differences) available for storm formation, and thus probably the intensity of storms (although the effect, like the effect of global warming itself, on storms may be negligible). But the blinds should be maneuverable enough, by using solar electric propulsion or "sailing" on sunlight pressure, to redeploy to deflect sunlight headed to extreme latitudes if polar ice sheet melting becomes a larger problem than equatorial heat.Instead of launching these vast (or vast number of) panels from the very deep gravity well of earth or manufacturing them on the moon (which probably lacks the proper organic ingredients and even sufficient water, a crucial industrial input), we can extract the raw materials from any near-earth asteroids containing water and methane ice or, if there are none such, from Jupiter-family comets. Besides the proper raw materials being available in sufficient volume in such ice, but probably not on the moon, there are a number of other advantages to microgravity ice mining explained in that linked article. If extracting material from comets and manufacturing the blinds can be automated the entire vast project can be conducted by launching just a few dozen of today's rockets using the recently-proven solar electric upper stages; otherwise it will require manned missions similar to those recently proposed to Mars, but again using solar-electric upper stages. (Solar electric rockets are only required for the first trip; much lower cost solar-thermal ice rockets can be used in subsequent trips, again as explained in that linked article).Of course shades don't combat other effects of excess carbon dioxide such as ocean acidification and faster and differential plant growth, but these effects alone do not justify the vast costs of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed faster plant growth is probably a major economic benefit.My off-the-cuff estimate of cost, which is probably as good as any recent NASA estimate for any of their gigaprojects, is that the project would cost $10 billion per year over 50 years. That's for the manned version; if it could be automated it would cost far less.   This is far cheaper than other space-based sunshade proposals because once initial capital costs are made and the first two or three bootstrapping cycles have been undertaken, the ongoing transport costs of material from comet to the earth-sun L1 point are extremely small. As a side benefit it would (unlike a mission to the moon or Mars or a "base" or any similar project) develop infrastructure needed for large-scale space industry and colonization. I propose funding the project, not with a tax, but by treating the blinds like a carbon dioxide sink and auctioning extra carbon dioxide credits for a global carbon dioxide market, since the shade allows us to be far less drastic in reducing growth of carbon dioxide emissions. If instead of a market we go with carbon taxes the project could be funded from those. $10 billion per year is much lower than even the most optimistic estimates (at 1% of world GDP about $500 billion per year) of the costs of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, there are a variety of other markets for large-scale industry that can be exploited once the basic ice mining infrastructure is developed: space tourism and making manned missions and other transportation around the solar system vastly less expensive, for starters, as well as providing propellant, tankage, and industrial raw materials in earth orbits.   As I stated in 1994:If the output of the icemaking equipment is high, even 10% of the original mass [returned to earth orbit by rockets using water propellant extracted from the comet ice] can be orders of magnitude cheaper than launching stuff from Earth. This allows bootstrapping: the cheap ice can be used to propel more equipment out to the comets, which can return more ice to Earth orbit, etc. Today the cost of propellant in Clarke [geosynchronous] orbit, the most important commercial orbit, is fifty  thousand dollars per kilogram. The first native ice mission might reduce this to a hundred dollars, and to a few cents after two or three bootstrapping cycles. The savings for transporting materials to the earth-sun L1 point, instead of launching them from earth, are even larger.
An important recent development in public key cryptography is the bilinear group, which for abstract algebra wonks is defined as follows (if you're not into abstract algebra feel free to skip to below):Bilinear groups are a set of three abstract algebraic groups, G1, G2 and GT , together with a deterministic function e, called a bilinear map, that takes as input one element from G1 and one element from G2 and outputs an element in GT . Suppose all three groups have order Q, element g1 generates group G1, and element g2 generates group G2. Then, one special property called bilinearity of the map e is that for all a, b < Q, we have that e(g1^a , g2^b) = e(g1, g2)^ab. This new element, e(g1, g2)^ab, is in group GT . The key observation is what happens to the exponents, a and b, during the mapping: they are multiplied. The group GT is distinct from both G1 or G2; thus the output of the mapping cannot be fed back into the map e as input.Elliptic curves are generally used for the groups, although bilinear schemes in at least some other algebras are also possible.Two of the main applications of bilinear groups are proxy re-signatures and proxy re-encryption.  In proxy re-signatures, a semi-trusted party transforms Alice's public key signature into Bob's.   The proxy does not have, cannot derive, and thus cannot sign with either Bob's secret key or with Alice's, but can only transform Alice's signature into Bob's.  The proxy re-signer is thus "semi-trusted" -- it is trusted with some things we normally would trust a proxy signer with, but not with others.  For example it is not trusted with either Alice's or Bob's private key, only with a special key that allows the signature transformation.The target signature could also be a group signature.   Thus, for example, Alice could sign her e-mail with her own digital signature, and a proxy re-signer sitting on the corporate e-mail firewall could re-sign the e-mail with the corporate group signature.  Proxy re-signers can be chained in a series, so that signature A is transformed by proxy AB into signature B, which is transformed by proxy BC into signature C, and so on.   The last signature Z proves that the message was signed by each proxy in the chain in order.  Proxy re-signers can also be chained together in a tree or directed acyclic graph.  (Note that threshold signatures by contrast do not require or prove that the signatures took place in a particular order).Proxy re-encryption is the same idea for public key encryption, with the added bonus that the re-encryptor can't read the message.   So, for example, we could have the following scheme to restrict the distribution of content:(1) Content owner Alice encrypts her content with her public key and publishes it to proxies P1, P2, etc., along with re-encryption keys AC1, AC2, etc. for each customer.  (2) Proxy allows customer to access the content only if paid.  When paid, the proxy re-encrypts to the customer using the re-encryption key for that customer.The proxies themselves are trusted neither with an ability to view the content nor with the discretion to distribute to additional customers not desired by content owner Alice.  The proxy is trusted only to restrict access to a customer. (I present this scheme mainly just to illustrate what proxy re-encryption does.  As an application, this particular content distribution scheme seems to me to only be useful if it somehow lowers transaction costs to route all payments through proxies rather than paying Alice directly, the latter which could be done by normal public-key cryptography, and of course it doesn't protect against a cheating customer re-publishing the content to the world).I suspect proxy re-encryption could simplify the design of digital mix schemes like onion routing -- this is left as an exercise for the cryptographically inclinded reader.This thesis is my source for most of this blog post; it discusses bilinear group cryptography for proxy re-encryption, proxy re-signing, and for reducing the trust needed for blinded offline digital cash.Legal caveat: many, if not most protocols based on bilinear groups seem to have been recently patented.
There have been over the years several plans and attempts to develop very fined grained markets online. There are several barriers to the success of such markets. An important barrier recently raised by Zooko in his comments on the Tahoe peer-to-peer disk backup project is the vulnerability of and to a centralized mint issuing money.One possible answer to central mint vulnerability is bit gold -- a currency the value of which does not depend on any particular trusted third party. Another alternative is an object barter economy.The key ideas of this nanobarter scheme are(1) the stuff to be traded (in Tahoe, disk space for backup) is represented by digital barter certificates (same protocol as digital cash, but every node is a "mint" that issues its own barter notes), and(2) default barter order and an agent ("market translator") that translates user behavior into barter orders. In the disk space economy, the default barter order might be to simply do a periodic barter that backs up N gigabytes of other peoples' disks in exchange for N gigabytes of their own. Many more sophisticated barter orders are also possible.If the reader is familiar with Menger's account of the origin of money from barter, this scheme is quite in the spirit of his scenario -- except that we reduce the transaction costs of barter by brute force automation instead of by making everybody choose a single currency.The transaction log and accounts are presented to the user in terms of a "pet currency"; the market translator automatically converts all different kinds of barter note prices into their pet currency values whenever prices need to be presented to the user.Every computer on the network (called a "node") runs a "mint" that issues "currency" (barter notes) backed by its commodity (e.g. disk space). In a simple system all disk space barter notes are treated as equivalent. Or there might be L different currencies corresponding the the L different kinds of leases in Tahoe. (In Tahoe a certain amount of disk space on a foreign disk is "leased" for a certain period of time). Indeed, a barter note is simply a lease in bearer form -- it can mean "I promise to bearer to provide G gigabytes of disk space for D days", or whatever the terms of the lease is.In a simple system, the barter note may simply be a ticket that never gets traded, merely issued and used. In a slightly more advanced system they trade but only at par value. A gigabyte is a gigabyte regardless of whose server its on -- this is a very simple proxy measure that excludes service quality from automated consideration. Since this is a nanomarket, there is normally no opportunity for the user to intervene with a more sophisticated or subjective judgment. Even a crude proxy measure, if full automated, may be sufficient for a nanomarket to outperform the non-nanomarket status quo (no transactions at all or the use of resource allocation algorithms, although the latter in a broad sense can be considered to be competing nanobarter systems).In a more sophisticated system (probably overkill for the purposes of Tahoe) some disk space notes trade at a discount because their backup services are unreliable. Bots "ping" the backup services provided by nodes to gather statistics on their reliability, and then buy reliable and sell unreliable notes. There are O((LN)^2) automated currency exchange products which these bots trade. The mental transaction cost problem caused by having O((LN)^2) prices with LN currencies is thus solved underneath the covers by these automated trading bots. The resulting trades are presented to users, if necessary, in terms of pet currencies, and we can have a large barter economy without the mental overhead of all those prices.To avoid the transaction costs of thinly traded markets, the bots might come to prefer the notes of one or a few services as "intermediate commodities" asMenger described, and most of the markets might become unused, leading to O(LN) actively traded markets -- an economy with a constant number of currencies and LN prices. But that's an entirely optional process that can be allowed to emerge. And with the right reliability-ping and arbitrage bots I suspect the transaction costs of thinly traded markets might be quite small, so that there is no compelling reasoning for a centralized currency to emerge and the added reliability of multiple currencies can be retained without the hassle (mental transaction costs) of users having to deal with multiple currencies.There are few computational transaction cost barriers left to developing nanotransactions -- the biggest is network delay time. The largest remaining barrier to nanomarkets is, for most kinds of transactions, mental transaction costs. User audits of nanotransactions cannot be both frequent and at fine granularity, or mental transaction costs quickly come to dwarf the value added by the market.   Any problems with nanomarkets that might require such audits must be handled in a highly automated fashion.The approaches to designing this automation all seem to start with developing reasonable proxy measures of service value. For nanomarkets it is far more important that these be measurable in fully automated fashion than that they be terribly accurate. After good proxy measures have been developed, one must obtain or estimate user preferences in terms of these measures. Obtaining preferences directly from the user has to be done in with traditional value granularites, otherwise mental transaction costs dominate. Alternatively, further proxy measures can be made that estimate user economic preferences from their normal input behavior. These are then compiled into automated nanotransactions with the market translator.
Beyond OilThe first installment of this series looked at the most highly developed offshore extraction industry, offshore oil. A wide variety of minerals besides oil are extracted on land. As technology improves, and as commodity prices remain high, more minerals are being extracted from beneath the sea. The first major offshore mineral beyond oil, starting in the mid 1990s, was diamond. More recently, there has been substantial exploration, research, and investment towards the development of seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits, which include gold, copper, and several other valuable metals in high concentrations. Today we look at mining diamonds from the sea.DiamondDe Beers' mining ship for their first South African marine diamond mine The first major area after oil was opened up by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in the 1990s -- marine diamond mining. The current center of this activity is Namibia, with offshore reserves estimated at more than 1.5 billion carats. The companies mining or planning to mine the Namibian sea floor with ROVs include Nambed (a partnership between the government and DeBeers, and the largest Namibian diamond mining company), Namco (which has been mining an estimated 3 million carats since discovering its subsea field in 1996), Diamond Fields Intl. (which expects to mine 40,000 carats a year from the sea floor), and Afri-Can (another big concession holder which is currently exploring its concessions and hopes to ramp up to large-scale undersea operations). Afri-Can has been operating a ship and crawler (ROV) that vacuums up 50 tons per hour gravel from a sea floor 90 to 120 meters below the surface and process the gravel for the diamonds. They found 7.2 carats of diamond per 100 cubic meters of gravel, which means the field is probably viable and further sampling is in order.DeBeers is also investing in a diamond mine in the seas off South Africa. A retrofitted ship will be used featuring a gravel processing planet capable of sorting diamonds from 250 tons of gravel per hour. It is hoped the ship will produce 240,000 carats a year when fully operational.The ship will engage inhorizontal mining, utilising an underwater vehicle mounted on twin Caterpillar tracks and equipped with an anterior suction system...The crawler's suction systems are equipped with water jets to loosen seabed sediments and sorting bars to filter out oversize boulders. The crawler is fitted with highly accurate acoustic seabed navigation and imaging systems. On board the vessel will be a treatment plant consisting of a primary screening and dewatering plant, a comminution mill sector followed by a dense media separation plant and finally a diamond recovery plant.In other words, a ROV will vacuum diamond-rich gravel off the sea floor, making a gravel slurry which is then piped to the ship, where it is then sifted for the diamonds. This is similar to the idea of pumping oil from the sea floor onto a FPSO -- a ship which sits over the wells and processes the oil, separates out the water, stores it, and offloads it onto visting oil tankers. However with marine diamond mining, instead of a fixed subsea tree capping and valving a pressurized oil field, a mobile ROV vacuums up a gravel slurry to be pumped through hoses to the ship.By contrast to this horizontal marine mining, vertical mining "uses a 6 to 7 meter diameter drill head to cut into the seabed and suck up the diamond bearing material from the sea bed."Coming soon: some new startup companies plan to mine extinct black smokers for copper, gold, and other valuable metals.
There is currently a hot debate at Marginal Revolution and elsewhere over Gregory Clark's new book, A Farewell to Alms.  I can't do Clark justice with a short explanation, but in brief he posits that the rich outbred the poor so quickly in medieval England that a eugenic effect occurred, giving the English traits of temperament such as harder work, longer time preferences, etc. that made the industrial revolution possible.  I find the political incorrectness of Clark's explanation refreshing, but I'm not convinced, given that the rich tended to outbreed the poor during most eras and in most cultures of history prior to the industrial revolution.   Even worse, Clark's theory can't explain why England fell behind most of the rest of Western Europe, and later most of the rest of the industrial world, in industrial and later economic progress after about 1870.  Genetic change doesn't work nearly that fast.I've argued that the printing press, combined with a free market in books and the resulting spread of literate culture and the rise of national languages, gave Europe an institutional superiority over other cultures of that era that is now hard to fathom.   As the term "literate culture" does not connote the radical shift in our very thought processes that occurred, I call this effect "book consciousness."This led, in the first instance, to Western European conquest of the world's seas and colonization all over the planet -- a conquest that has been substantially reversed and could not be duplicated today because now most of the world shares book consciousness. It also led to a radical change in the way work skills were taught to children, which along with the scientific revolution and other fruits of the printing press led to the industrial revolution.  Clark's own data on wages and productivity can best be explained, I believe, by the radical changes in child investment strategy reflected in Protestant Reformation and a central aspect of book consciousness.Finally, the industrial revolution occurred first in England rather than other parts of Western Europe due to  the security advantages of being an island.   Not at all coincidentally, England was by 1800 the leading colonial power. England was protected at low cost by its navies from most of the organized violence that ravaged the continent.  This allowed it to develop a more secure regime of property rights, which in turn lowered the risks of the large capital outlays needed for industrialization.  For a similar reason Japan initially outpaced its continental Asian rivals in industrialization.Here's a link to the debate at Marginal Revolution.
During my blog absence, I've been studying, designing, and implementing a style of programming I call temporal programming.   It is useful for, among other things, implementing smart contracts.  Meanwhile, I encourage readers interested in programming to check out Node.js.  Temporal programming starts with event-oriented programming and takes it further.  Temporal programming will give us control over when our instructions get executed: the plodding do this, then that, then the other, as if machine activities are only supposed to happen in one big long sequence and merely output some big long tape, will be relegated to secondary status.  More to come.--------Is Netflix management really stupid?   To summarize Megan McCardle, no: under copyright law, DVDs are covered by the first sale rule -- once you buy a DVD, you can't make a copy, but you can sell, rent or give away the DVD itself.  Streaming, on the other hand, essentially involves making a copy, and you can't do it legally without the copyright owner's permission. So to stream the most demanded content, you usually need the permission of owners, and thus have to pay what they demand.It thus makes complete sense that Netflix has to charge high prices for streaming -- because for the kind of content they want to stream (i.e. the copyrights that are so valuable that their owners bother to prevent the content from being distributed on YouTube), content owners are demanding revenues similar to what they are accustomed to via cable.  I'd add that the first sale rule also explains why Netflix, contrary to its name, originally succeeded in out-competing a gaggle of Internet video streaming companies by the stone-age method of shipping DVDs by mail. The main thing Netflix may have done wrong was, after succeeding in pivoting from Internet streaming to mailing DVDs, going back to their original goal in a way that set false expectations about prices (i.e. that streaming prices would be closer to DVD rental prices than to cable TV).  Probably what happened is that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings thought he could use his mail-order rental business as leverage to negotiate lower prices with copyright owners, but this strategy did not succeed.It also makes sense that Netflix (and their streaming competitors) lack licensed content due to copyright owners' long-standing aversion to Internet streaming.   All this was happening to Netflix's video-streaming competitors long before Netflix's much more recent emphasis on that business.   Netflix apparently hasn't, after all, solved the institutional problem that their DVD-shipping model worked around.---------Bit gold and I make brief appearances in Wired's Bitcoin article.---------Water remains fun.

This article at The Register is the best layman's description I've seen. The basic idea is that Alice and Bob start by sharing a "key" that is a location and time interval for measuring radio transmissions from the same quasar. The couple (you didn't know that Alice and Bob are an item now?) can then use the voluminous "truly random" data generated by the quasar to generate secret cryptographic keys. Presumably the visible universe has so many quasars that it's sufficiently improbable that the adversary could guess and sufficiently difficult for the adversary to constantly observe all the quasars in order to observe and identify the transmission being observed by Alice and Bob.There is an interesting discussion about the idea at Bruce Schneier's blog. However, while this discussion addressed several smaller problems that must be solved before this technique can become practical and widespread, the discussion failed to address one issue that should be glaring.The biggest problem, which must be addressed with any physics-based "truly random" number scheme, is how do we know that these signals are "truly random"? On what physical theories and assumptions is this claim based? How do we know that scientists won't in the future learn more about how quasars work or discover new scientific laws that demonstrate regularity in the data once deemed random? Of course, as any good cryptographer knows, the fact that such data has passed all the statistical tests that we've so far devised is merely suggestive and hardly proves that the data is truly random, any more than it proves that a pseudorandom data stream is secure. There has to be a more basic argument to prove randomness, such as implausibility of >>c communications with respect to causality that would occur if certain quantum phenomena were not truly random.This is a problem that needs to be addressed for any "truly random" source, but some physical randomness assumptions and arguments are better than others. This is certainly not something we should take on faith or leave to physicists who by "randomness" merely refer to standard statistical tests rather than cryptographic criteria.See my articles on "true randomness" and the use of statistical tests in cryptography for more about this problem.
Today was the probably biggest day in patent law since the passage of the 1952 Patent Act. By a unanimous (9-0) vote, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled decades of Federal Circuit holdings in the most controversial area of patent law, obviousness. And by a 7-1 vote, it ringingly re-affirmed the doctrine that U.S. legal language should be construed to not encroach on foreign jurisdictions unless it expressly does so -- implicitly criticizing the Federal Circuit's failure to respect foreign patent jurisdictions and reversing it outright in the area of software export.You'd think that engineers, who make the vast majority of inventions, would be the most enthusiastic supporters of our patent system. But most engineers find our patent system problematic, and by far their greatest objection is the plague of trivial patents. This is largely governed by the statutory language forbidding "obvious" patents. This is a notoriously ambiguous word that gives rise to a notoriously subjective area of law. In an effort to provide clarity, the Federal Circuit in recent decades went beyond old Supreme Court precedent and set up a requirement that the patent challenger must show a "teaching, motivation, or suggestion" in the prior art to combine the patent claim's elements in order to show that a patent claim was obvious. It was not enough that common sense or the vast majority of engineers in the field found the patent to be trivial.  The Federal Circuit's doctrine thus gave rise to a a flood of trival patents in exchange for achieving some objectivity and clarity.   Today in KSR v. Teleflex, the Court rejected this tradeoff and argued that subjectivity ("common sense") should also be used to find patents obvious -- that the Federal Circuit's "teaching, suggestion, or motivation" requirement was far too strict. Instead, the Court held that common sense arguments could be made.  The Court also specifically held in KSR that instead of just looking at obviousness in the context of the problem the problem the patentee was trying to solve, "any need or problem known in the field or endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed."  This provides a much needed expansion of the power to prove a patent obvious without decreasing the clarity or objectivity of the test.  Along the same lines, the relevant prior art need not solve the same kind of problem -- the obviousness analysis should include elements from prior art even where that art solved different problems from those addressed by the current patent.  Whether the changes to the prior art produce result that could be predicted by your typical engineer in the field (in patent parlance, a "person of ordinary skill in the art" or POSITA) is also strongly relevant -- if the function that results from changing or combining elements from the prior art is predictable by our POSITA, given what is already known about how those elements work individually, the claimed change to or combination of those elements is probably obvious.   Unlike the "common sense" approach, the any-purpose and predictable-function tests are quite objective and clear, and I hope the Federal Circuit strongly and fully adheres to them in future obviousness cases.I'm proud to observe that two of the professors whose patent classes I enjoyed the most, Professor Robert Brauneis and Professor John Duffy, helped KSR make its case for a broader and stronger obviousness standard that should become one of the strongest precedents ever set in U.S. patent law.Also today in Microsoft v. ATT, the Court came out very strongly for the doctrine that, unless there is express language in U.S. statutes covering extraterritorial acts, U.S. patent law should be construed to not cover them. Seven Justices came out strongly in favor of strict construction in this sense, with only one dissent. Microsoft also holds that mere software instructions do not constitute "components" of patented products: only their specific physical instantiations do. The statutory language makes it an act of infringement to export "components" of patented products overseas that can be easily assembled into a product which if manufactured, sold, or used in the U.S. would infringe the U.S. patent. Microsoft Windows had already been held to violate AT&T's patent when copied, sold or used in the U.S. When Microsoft snail-mailed a master disk of Windows code overseas, and when it sent Windows code overseas over the Internet, the Federal Circuit held that these acts constituted exporting "component(s)" of Windows and thus was also an infringement. Seven Justices disagreed with the Federal Circuit but differed a bit on just what constitutes a "component". Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Scalia, and Souter argued that a specific copy of code instantiated on the specific disk to be installed in the target computer is a component. Justices Alito, Breyer and Thomas disagreed, opining that only software when running on a computer constituted a component -- even the code residing on the specific disk to be installed into a specific computer does not. Only, surprisingly, Justice Stevens dissented that the export of a master disk in this case in itself constituted exporting "the functional equivalent of a warehouse of components" and thus a "component" under the statutory language.  I agree with Stevens that software is more analogous to a player piano roll than to the notes on a sheet of music to which the plurality compared it, although I disagree with his conclusion.  In the case of a player piano roll and software the human mediated in their execution is trivial -- simply starting up the machine so that the instructions can be copied from the roll or disk and executed on the machine, whereas the blueprints and sheets of music cited by the majority are human- but not machine-interpreted design documents.  A 19th century player piano ready to play the instructions on its paper roll.Stevens is right about the analogy, but he misses the point correctly emphasized by the majority -- that statutes are to be construed narrowly to avoid encroaching on extraterritorial jurisdiction.   This doctrine argues strongly for not assuming that Congress meant "component" to include anything more than physical parts -- it does not include mere instructions even when those instructions can be automatically executed and constitute the practical entirety of the invention.  The majority also pointed out an important policy consideration that Congress probably did not consider: that it might be impossible for the exporter of software to control subsequent overseas acts of copying and use that constitute infringement, and thereby problematic to hold said exporter liable for it, whereas in the case of physical parts the degree of infringement is strictly limited by the number of parts exported.The Court's ringing restatement of the doctrine that U.S. statutory law be construed to not encroach on extraterritorial jurisdictions could have implications in a number of areas such as the Federal Circuit's holding that foreign sales will not be recognized under the first sale exhaustion rule and cases where the patent's components, for example network nodes, reside in several countries, rather than in a single country.  In Jazz Photo  the Federal Circuit held that it would act as if sales that occurred outside the U.S. simply didn't occur -- rather like holding that your purchase of a car in Canada cannot be recognized in the U.S., so that you have no right to complain if it is stolen. In the infamous Blackberry case, it held that, because one of the components of RIM's network and RIM's Blackberry wireless e-mail users were located in the U.S., RIM infringed the U.S. patent, even though most of the functionality that violated the patent was located at a relay station and server farm in Canada. The patent challenger in that case had the same option the Court said AT&T had in this case -- to get a Canadian patent and protect its rights in Canada. Instead, it obtained only a U.S. patent and used that patent successfully in the Federal Circuit to attack foreign activities more properly addressed under Canadian jurisdiction. There are many other cases where the Federal Circuit has short-shrifted foreign patent jurisdiction and I hope today's ringing call to respect these jurisdictions will be heeded by the Federal Circuit and that it will thus revisit many of its relevant holdings.  Chief Justice Roberts, a great fan of achieving unanimity in order to boost the authority of the Court, was able to create unanimity here in a barely disguised effort to teach the Federal Circuit that it, and not the Federal Circuit, is the Supreme Court in patent law as elsewhere. The Federal Circuit hears the vast majority of patent appeals and for decades it has acted as the de facto  supreme court of patents. In those rare cases where the real Supreme Court spoke on patents the Federal Circuit often construed its holdings quite narrowly and continued on much as before. Roberts' ability to create unanimity in KSR and near unanimity in Microsoft will hopefully go a long way towards persuading the Federal Circuit to more closely and fully follow Supreme Court precedents in the patent field.I'll probably have much more to say about these two landmark cases in the future.Here are the full opinions:KSR v.

Moral hazard and risk compensation for hikers.If they had not been toting the device that works like Onstar for hikers, "we would have never attempted this hike," one of them said after the third rescue crew forced them to board their chopper.I hope everybody by now knows about the moral hazard and risk compensation that comes with securitization, and the central role of novel mortgage securitization in the recent financial crisis that led to the current recession.  If not, here's a good example:By buying his mortgages and thus freeing up his capital to solicit even more business, Fannie and Freddie are a big reason Mr. Mozilo has driven [now-defunct sub-prime lender] Countrywide past the Citigroups and the Wells Fargos to the top of the mortgage heap. "If it wasn't for them," he said of Fannie and Freddie, "Wells knows they'd have us."Here's my analysis of incentives and clocks:Mechanical clocks, bell towers, and sandglasses provided the world’s first fair and fungible measure of sacrifice.  So many of the things we sacrifice for are not fungible, but we can arrange our affairs around the measurement of the sacrifice rather than its results.  Merchants and workers alike used the new precision of clock time to prove, brag, and complain about their sacrifices.If you want something in an emergency you can wait in line, pay through the nose, or do without: choose one.  Similar lessons apply to the current health care debate:In emergencies rationing becomes extreme: people wait in long lines, pay "extortionate" prices, or, even worse, do without. We are thrown into economically unfamiliar territory and transaction costs balloon. Goods will always be rationed in one or more of the above four ways, and in an emergency the rationing can be quite severe. Our charitable spirit can temporarily overcome self-interest, but it can't overcome the knowledge problem or the scarcity of goods. Even in emergencies, when charity is most likely to spring forth, we need incentives.  For example, doctors in emergencies are an interesting exception to the general rule in contract law against officious intermeddlers: if you are a patient who is in no position to consent or decline treatment, a doctor can go ahead and treat you and bill you.  An implied-in-law or "quasi" contract has been formed.  The same is not true in almost any other case: if that annoying windshield-washing guy starts cleaning your window without your consent, or if the neighbor kid comes along one day and mows your law without permission, you don't legally owe them a thing.
One thing I've notice as smart contracts have been evolving (rather obliviously to the idea of smart contracts) is that they are being implemented in little pieces. For example, instead of the full-blown protocol I describe in that article, wherein the ability of one's car to start is automatically tied to the lateness of one's payments, the "auto repo auto" has been implemented as a somewhat simpler gizmo that responds to radio signals from a trusted (and legally regulated) party: a "starter-interrupt device." Instead of a full-blown market translator, we get simple gizmos like this price-sensitive thermostat. Both the market translator and the price-sensitive thermostat reduce mental transaction costs by obtaining consumer preferences and translating them into purchasing decisions. The price-sensitive thermostat has the advantage that people already enter their preferences into thermostats, so there is already a digital source of preferences.
Tom Bell and Glenn Whitman have engaged in an interesting debate over to what extent intellectual property rights conflict with tangible property rights, and to what extent intellectual property rights, like tangible property rights, are natural rights.   Roughly speaking, Bell defines natural rights as those rights that would emerge in a "state of nature," i.e. in the absence of government law enforcement.  Bell correctly observes that real and personal property rights would emerge, but argues that at least generally intellectual property rights would not.  I think this is only partially true.   One poster responds with the example of symbols of office or other social status (jewelry, seals, feathers, etc.) that exist in all civilizations and most neolithic and hunter-gatherer tribes.  I'd add that in England, at least, offices themselves were property rights.   Indeed, English feudal and royal titles have followed for at least centuries the same inheritance rules as those for real property, and were categorized in common law as property (Blackstone described this well).  Furthermore, trademark emerged in the common law, suggesting it would also emerge in the absence of the state.  Academic norms of anti-plagiarism are a form of IP-like rights that we can observe today being enforced outside of government.  The Domain Name System (DNS) on the Internet, and the related Internet Protocol address space, were enforced without the formal legal recognition of rights in these areas long before the DNS was discovered by the government legal system.  Indeed, title in tangible property implies a similar right to an accurate public attribution of who owns what rights.  The common law of defamation gives a person some further rights in the accuracy of communications of others regarding oneself.Trademark, DNS, plagiarism, and defamation are rights of accuracy in labeling, attribution, and other descriptions related to a person.  There are some natural rights to demand of another person's communications that they accurately label and attribute objects and content related to oneself in certain ways, such as ownership or origination.  It's harder, though, to argue that copyright and patent have natural rights analogs.  One has to go from a right that a content or idea (as well as property and self) be properly attributed to a person, to imputing to that person a right to exclude others from communications of that content (copyright) or use of that idea (patent), despite that content or idea being instantiated in somebody else's personal property.  The predecessors of copyright were the rights of lords and bishops to control speech and writing within their domain -- a dubious origin given our First Amendment ideals.   Copyright still conflicts with free expression.   P2P networks originated as proposals for networks that it would be impossible for repressive governments to censor.  It turns out, though, that censorship-free networks are also copyright-free networks.  Copyright and censorship both rely on having “gatekeepers” who the government can coerce in order to control content.   The state of nature on the Internet is copyright-free as well as censorship-free.In summary, it's much harder to justify as natural law copyrights and patents than legal areas like trademark and defamation that involve the accuracy rather than ownership of information.
Way back in 1994 I wrote the following (the "keys" here were envisioned as digital codes acting as car keys):If a loan was taken out to buy that car, and the owner failed to make payments, the smart contract could automatically invoke a lien, which returns control of the car keys to the bank. This smart lien might be much cheaper and more effective than a repo man. I've since used this as one of the key examples of smart contracts, in particular smart contracts that help enforce security interests (collateral). Other kinds of smart contracts include digital rights management (for copyright licenses), financial cryptography (for payment systems and other kinds of financial contracts), price-sensitive controllers, and a wide variety of other possibilities. More recently, some real-world examples of the "auto-repo-auto" have appeared, and it is now becoming more common. Deborah Yao describes some more of these:Starter-interrupt devices are becoming a popular way for lenders to ensure they get paid, and consumers seem willing to accept them to get into nicer cars, use a smaller down payment and qualify for a lower interest rate, according to device manufacturers....The companies make a variation of the same device: The units are connected to the starter and emit a brief series of sounds or flashes of light, days before the payment deadline. If the customer then makes a timely payment, he or she can contact the dealer for a new code that will allow them to operate the vehicle. Some devices are remotely controlled by dealers. Note that the process is far more manual and that there is much more attention to the user interface than I was thinking about in 1994. It's becoming increasingly apparent that a good user interface is often key to good security (phishing is another big example of this). Contracts are ultimately relationships between people, so a smart contract protocol needs to go all the way from end to end -- from person to person. Furthermore, as long as the parties have access to a good legal system, making certain important steps manual is a good idea if it increases flexibility and safety without too substantially decreasing security or user friendliness.My thanks to Ian Grigg for pointing me to Yao's article.
It is a gross violation of Occam's Razor to attribute the recent very broad-based run-up in dollar commodity prices primarily to the plethora of disparate causes to which they have been attributed: "peak oil", the war in Iraq, ethanol subsidies displacing food, and so on. Rises in industrial demand, increases in the costs of transporting commodities due to high oil prices, and so on explain only a small fraction of the rise in other commodity prices, and do not explain at all why precious metal prices have increased alongside those of other commodities. Occam's Razor points us, as it did to wise investors and economists in the 1970s, to the one kind of commodity all these other commodities have in common: the currencies they are priced in.In the 1980s, there were just as many of these disparate bullish factors for commodities as in the 1970s and as today. In the 1980s there was increasing industrial demand in Asia and the developing world, and the Iran/Iraq war drove insurance rates for oil tankers in the Persian Gulf into the stratosphere, yet commodity prices in dollars and dollar-linked currencies broadly fell, due to the emphasis of the Federal Reserve on fighting inflation throughout the 1980s.Commodity prices now reflect more the value of commodities as stores of value and hedges or media of exchange, i.e. their values as money substitutes or hedges, than they reflect demand for their industrial consumption. The trend lines for global industrial demand have not really changed that much -- the increases in Asia are largely offset by slower demand growth in Europe and the U.S., and at today's high prices we will see industrial demand slowly fall in the U.S. and Europe and level off in Asia.But demand for the oft-dreaded but ill-understood "hoarding" and "speculation", that is storing extra commodities (often off-the-books, or at least not in the officially measured warehouses) and the purchase of extra commodity futures and other commodity derivatives to hedge transactions based on government currencies, will remain strong as long as the Federal Reserve continues to inflate the dollar supply, and as long as many developing countries continue to link their currencies to this dollar. Commodity prices in dollars will level off, and then move back down close to historical trends based largely on just industrial consumption, if or when the Fed stops increasing the supply of dollars faster than the demand for dollars. If the Fed continues trying to inflate its way out of the latest bubble-following slump, commodities will not be the next bubble: instead they will form the basis of the new de facto currencies of high finance. SeeThe monetary value of liquid commoditiesandCommodity derivatives: the new currenciesObviously the euro also plays a big role, but it is important to observe that the euro too has inflated, just to a lesser degree than the dollar. The euro has not developed the track record that would make many international investors think euro-denominated debt does not need to be hedged with commodity derivatives. Some wise investors still remember the hyper-inflations and outright defaults of the late 1920s and early 1930s that made many government bonds almost worthless, the destruction in the value of the U.S. debt in the 1970s from inflation, and many similar episodes. In these circumstances commodities are usually safer than government debt denominated in the fiat currencies of the same governments that owe that debt.That's why the current flight to safety involves commodities as much or more than it involves government debt, and indeed the debts of less robust governments (ranging from municipalities in developed countries to the national debts of less developed countries) are no longer considered safe. It is well known by now that U.S. Treasuries are "safe deposit boxes" that pay negative real rates of interest -- i.e. one must pay for the privilege of storing one's wealth in a form backed by the vast future revenues of the IRS. They are a way losing one's wealth with less rapidity and volatility than with many alternative investments, not a way of actually building wealth. Commodities also store rather than build wealth. By contrast to Treasuries, commodities are more volatile, but are not subject to unknown future amounts of fiat currency inflation. A mix of U.S. Treasuries, European debt, and commodity derivatives now forms the ideal safe "store the cash under your bed" portfolio. Government debt alone is far too risky during periods when central banks are not strongly committed to reigning in money supplies.[The above is based on comments I made at the Marginal Revolution blog].
 Astronomers have now observed dark matter separate itself out from normal matter. Normally dark matter and ordinary matter are too well mixed to observe separately. However, when galaxy clusters collide at high velocity (the cloud observed here was produced by a 4,700 kilometer per second collision) ordinary and dark matter can become separated.In this research, the position of hot gas (ordinary matter) in a vast odd cloud resulting from such a collision was measured with an x-ray telescope. The center of gravity of the combined ordinary and dark matter was observed by measuring its gravitational lensing effect on bright galaxies behind the cloud with an optical telescope. The difference between the two positions showed that the dark matter (which normally outweighs ordinary matter 6 to 1) had become separated from the ordinary matter.The leading explanation for the separation is that the dark matter doesn't experience drag from electromagnetic forces -- it only reacts to gravity -- and thus doesn't get as perturbed from a collision as ordinary matter.The image above shows dark matter positioned as indicated by gravitional lensing (blue) painted onto the optical image. This video shows a simulation of galaxy clusters made out of dark matter (blue) and ordinary matter (red) colliding and producing such a cloud. More here.Astronomer Sean Carroll says this research "proves beyond a reasonable doubt" that dark matter exists. I love it when scientists talk my language. :-)
So asks gwern in a spectacular display of hindsight.The short answer about why it took so long is that the bit gold/Bitcoin ideas were nowhere remotely close to being as obvious gwern suggests.   They required a very substantial amount of unconventional thought, not just about the security technologies gwern lists  (and I'm afraid the list misses one of the biggest ones, Byzantine-resilient peer-to-peer replication), but about how to choose and put together these protocols and why.    Bitcoin is not a list of cryptographic features, it's a very complex system of interacting mathematics and protocols in pursuit of what was a very unpopular goal. While the security technology is very far from trivial, the "why" was by far the biggest stumbling block -- nearly everybody who heard the general idea thought it was a very bad idea.   Myself, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).   Only Finney (RPOW) and Nakamoto were motivated enough to actually implement such a scheme.The "why" requires coming to an accurate understanding of the nature of two difficult and almost always misunderstood topics, namely trust and the nature of money.  The overlap between cryptographic experts and libertarians who might sympathize with such a "gold bug" idea is already rather small, since most cryptographic experts earn their living in academia and share its political biases.   Even among this uncommon intersection as stated very few people thought it was a good idea.  Even gold bugs didn't care for it because we already have real gold rather than mere bits and we can pay online simply by issuing digital certificates based on real gold stored in real vaults, a la the formerly popular e-gold.  On top of the plethora of these misguided reactions and criticisms, there remain many open questions and arguable points about these kinds of technologies and currencies, many of which can only be settled by actually fielding them and seeing how they work in practice, both in economic and security terms.  Here are some more specific reasons why the ideas behind Bitcoin were very far from obvious:(1) only a few people had read of the bit gold ideas, which although I came up with them in 1998  (at the same time and on the same private mailing list where Dai was coming up with b-money -- it's a long story) were mostly not described in public until 2005, although various pieces of it I described earlier, for example the crucial Byzantine-replicated chain-of-signed-transactions part of it which I generalized into what I call secure property titles.(2) Hardly anybody actually understands money.  Money just doesn't work like that, I was told fervently and often.  Gold couldn't work as money until it was already shiny or useful for electronics or something else besides money, they told me.  (Do insurance services also have to start out useful for something else, maybe as power plants?)  This common argument coming ironically from libertarians who misinterpreted Menger's account of the origin of money as being the only way it could arise (rather than an account of how it could arise) and, in the same way misapplying Mises' regression theorem.   Even though I had rebutted these arguments in my study of the origins of money, which  I humbly suggest should be should be required reading for anybody debating the economics of Bitcoin.There's nothing like Nakamoto's incentive-to-market scheme to change minds about these issues.  :-)   Thanks to RAMs full of coin with "scheduled deflation", there are now no shortage of people willing to argue in its favor.(3) Nakamoto improved a significant security shortcoming that my design had, namely by requiring a proof-of-work to be a node in the Byzantine-resilient peer-to-peer system to lessen the threat of an untrustworthy party controlling the majority of nodes and thus corrupting a number of important security features.   Yet another feature obvious in hindsight, quite non-obvious in foresight.(4)  Instead of my automated market to account for the fact that the difficulty of puzzles can often radically change based on hardware improvements and cryptographic breakthroughs (i.e. discovering algorithms that can solve proofs-of-work faster), and the unpredictability of demand, Nakamoto designed a Byzantine-agreed algorithm adjusting the difficulty of puzzles.   I can't decide whether this aspect of Bitcoin is more feature or more bug, but it does make it simpler.
Most modern governments have political structures and legal procedures derived in a long evolution from those of the ancient Roman emperors, with a shallow overlay of modern democracy. The main exceptions, the Anglo-American countries, have legal procedures derived primarily from a partially independent evolution in England, but still with substantial influences from the old Roman autocrats.   Political ideas and legal procedures are closely related, and versions of these derived from the Roman Empire have dominated most of European history.  I have started writing a history of this legal and political tradition.  It starts with the Year of the Five Emperors, the rise of the Severan dynasty, and under that dynasty the first two major jurists (legal authorities) in the later Roman legal tradition, Papinian and Ulpian.   It continues through the famous Codes of the emperor Justinian (as compiled by his jurist Tribonian), to the birth of universities in Western Europe upon the rediscovery of Justinian's codes, through the political philosophies of Bodin and Hobbes, to the Reception of Roman law into Western Europe, to the Code Napoleon, the German and Russian legal codes, and modern dictatorships based on the political and legal ideas of Rome.   This will be a sprawling history and indeed I will probably never finish it.  But meanwhile I will post a good bit of it to this blog, starting with the next post.   I expect to proceed largely in temporal order, but no guarantees.   Quite a few of my blog posts over the next two years may be part of this series.   It should be quite enjoyable as well as provide unique insights into the history of political forms and constitutions.
TipIt proposes to include a content aggregation feature showing the best-tipped pieces of content, since a tip is more credible than your typical content vote on an aggregator like digg or reddit. This suggests to me an even bigger idea: to provide similar incentives for Internet tipping as we have for tipping at a dinner out -- to make it an expected social practice -- combine tipping with content aggregators like reddit or digg or socializing services like facebook with features as described below.With content we don't know how much it's worth until we've already consumed it (a classic measurement problem). A tip would solve this problem, but a tip is a social thing and requires more than just a payment.If I were doing TipIt I'd change the design in four ways. First, I'd add generosity signal features that inform one's friends or fellow tippers as well as the tipee about the tip. This could be in the form of aggregator "karma" points that name and ranks the most generous tippers. This would be like the "karma" points which people who add content to a social aggregator compete for, but it signals far more -- it signals that one is a generous tipper as well as a generous contributor of reccomendations. There are a variety of other ways (home or facebook pages, e-mail, etc.) that generosity signals might similarly be sent within a social circle.Secondly, I'd add it to an existing aggregator rather than starting a whole new service from scratch.Third, I'd add some extra security (cryptography, natch :-)Fourth, I wouldn't try to aggregate "microtips." I think these will have the same kinds of problems that micropayments have. Instead, I'd make the tips nice round numbers in increments of 50 cents or a dollar. That makes it simple for people to keep track of their own tips and their friend's tips.So here's how it might work:Your client software (perhaps just a web page script) pays the tip (using an already existing system like PayPal) to the content provider, perhaps via the aggregator, and publishes a cryptographic proof that you made the tip. The aggregator verifies the proof (if it's not the payment intermediary it does this by cross-checking with the tipee), registers the vote, and shows that you made the tip. This signals to others both that the content is appreciated, that you are a generous tipper (thus transporting the social incentive to tip from dining out to the Internet), that you have good taste, and that you put your money where your digg vote is.Optionally, it could publish a bit of HTML code on the tipper's own blog or home page, that links to the aggregator and shows how much a person has tipped. It could send out e-mails to the tipper's friends recommending the content and, along the way, informing the friends of the generosity of the tip.If content tipping on the Internet will work at all -- and given the measurement problem of content it would be very nice if it would work - I think it's much more likely to work well if done in a social fashion like this.
John Law and the Mississippi Bubble are fairly well-known to economic historians, but one wonders whether the supposed economic experts who run the U.S. Federal Reserve remember it.To briefly summarize (and necessarily oversimply), Law was an economist and gambler put in charge of the French central bank in the early 18th century.  The bank issued notes (i.e. paper money) backed primarily reserves of, not gold or silver, nor French sovereign debt, but of stock in the Mississippi Company, which owned huge tracks of recently acquired, but hardly settled, American frontier land.  In other words, the currency was backed by speculative real estate ventures.  After a few good years, the scheme quickly collapsed in hyperinflation and bankruptcy.Fast forward to today.  The Federal Reserve has traditionally used as reserves, on top of some gold, U.S. federal debt (Treasuries), considered a "risk free" investment (actually they are by market measures of risk generally the lowest risk, but not risk-free, as anyone holding Treasuries during periods of dollar inflation can attest to).  Quite recently, however, this has changed:What has replaced Treasuries in the Fed's hoard?  Here's how Randy Waldman puts it:The difference, about $475B, represents an investment by the central bank in risky assets of the US financial sector.In other words, the Fed has been replacing the lowest-risk asset, U.S. Treasuries, with assets considered such high risks that trading has often practically halted on them, i.e. the securitized forms of U.S. real estate debt incurred by people who now, we are finding, often cannot or do not pay off their loans.  The Federal Reserve is now backing the dollar with securities that have been found to be full of moral hazard.The Fed does have a tool for eliminating most of this debt problem: inflation.  If the Fed can flood the economy with enough dollars, presumably enough of these will reach debtors that they will be able to continue paying their mortgages.  By investing in shaky debt, Fed has given itself a huge incentive to further inflate the dollar.  It has given itself further incentive to fleece holders of dollar liabilities, including investors in dollar-denominated debt, in order to bail out the real estate market. We have seen a massive runup in commodity prices during the the same period during which real estate debt has replaced Treasuries in the Fed's portfolio.  The dollar has already fallen steeply, and people ranging from retirement funds to second- and third-tie consumers of commodities are hedging against a quite possible further collapse of the dollar.  Commodity producers are betting against the dollar by keeping commodities in the ground instead of ramping up production, and food is being stockpiled in every poor country where the currency is linked to the dollar.  As I recently wrote:The dichotomy [most economic commentators have made] between a presumably inefficient "bubble" caused by "speculation" and fundamental (geological and technological) scarcity presents a false choice.The more likely alternative is that the parallel price rises of practically all commodities (not just oil) are a rational and socially efficient response to the inflation (M3 etc.) of the dollar and to a lesser extent of the euro. The vast increase in "non-commercial" or "speculative" participation in commodity futures reflects a greatly increased use of commodities over the last 5 years for their monetary qualities, just as Carl Menger and others would predict. See Commodity Derivatives: the New Currencies and The "Hoarding" and "Speculation" in Commodities.
In the ongoing debate at Marginal Revolution over Gregory Clark's new book A Farewell to Alms -- which I highly recommend, despite my criticisms -- he wrote the following:"The widespread impression that between 1300 and 1800 England experienced significant institutional improvements is just wrong. There were changes, yes. But not improvements."To which I responded:Some important institutional changes -- some of them arguably radical improvements -- in England between 1300 and 1800:* The mechanical clock, 14th century. The resulting rise of clock culture and the time wage may have slowly but radically improved the coordination and work habits of Europeans. Earlier adaptation to clock culture, a process that may take centuries to evolve, may explain the large discrepencies between European and many non-European laborer work habits that Clark cites.* The printing press and the rise of book consciousness, which radically decreased the costs of teaching economically important knowledge to both children and adults. The rise of book consciousness, reflected in the literacy and book cost data Clark graphs, explains the most prominent puzzle revealed by Clark's data: the fact that skills and innovation rose dramatically even as the rewards to skills were stagnant or declined.* Nationalization the Church in England and secularization of family law, 16th century.* The incorporation of the Lex Mercatoria into the common law, and the resulting rise of modern contract law, 18th century. Indeed, much of this occured in the same decades as the start of the industrial revolution.* The "Romanization" of property law, rendering land more freely saleable, divisible, and mortgageable, which Adam Smith noted was an important improvement still in process at his time.* The rise of marine insurance (e.g. Lloyd's of London) and the associated rise of colonialism and world trade, 17th-18th century.* The decline of guilds and monopolies, 16th-18th centuries. Medieval England was certainly not a highly competitive market economy. Commerce in goods was dominated rather by monopolies and a variety of price and quality controls instituted by guilds and towns.Here is more of the debate at MR.
Here's a good summary of the Cuthbert case in which playing around in the United Kingdom with URLs (e.g. adding "../.." in front of them) landed a web user in prison.   The conviction was probably based at least as much on what Cuthbert said he was trying to do by typing this (testing the security to determine whether the site was a phishing site or a genuine one -- a good but illegal intent) as on what he actually typed.Poorly written statutes like these produce all sorts of bad effects and injustices.  What does it mean for a  computer access to be "unauthorized"?   For a cybercrime convinction to be just, there should at least be notice (analogous to a "no trespassing sign") and cautionary affordance (analogous to a door or a fence that one cannot cross by accident).  Stay tuned for more comments on this here in the next week or so.Ian Grigg and Adam Shostack also have some interesting comments on this case.
The SETI League has published a short article describing my strategy for what some have dubbed "interstellar archaeology", namely the use of astronomical instruments to look for alien artifacts in other star systems or galaxies.  In contrast to SETI, which listens for radio or optical transmissions, interstellar archaeology is looking for material structures.  The connection between surface engineering and strategies that look for alien constructions seems quite obvious to me, now that I have thought of it, but I've done a literature and Internet search and haven't seen the connection made by others.  The discussions seem to be all about the design of these hypothetical astrostructures themselves rather than about what astronomical instruments could give us a great deal of information about, if there are any to be seen, namely their surfaces.  My strategy emphasizes that, whatever the alien structure may be, we would be looking at its surface.  Artificial surfaces tend to be highly engineered for useful thermal and optical properties.  The spectra of artificial satellites, painted surfaces, skyscraper windows, and so on exhibit many features which are extremely improbable in nature.  For example, skyscraper windows and spacecraft surfaces often have gold at concentrations millions of times higher than stellar dust clouds, because of gold's very good thermal and optical functions.  There are also many artificial molecules used in paints, again with unique spectra that would stand out from natural galactic features.   Advanced ETI may have moved on to more advanced surfaces, but whatever they use, it is very likely to have highly unnatural spectra in order to optimize its function.   My surface-engineering-based search strategy has the added benefit that it doesn't matter how large any individual structure is, so long as a collection of artifacts collectively present surfaces that look artificial enough to stand out from natural galactic spectra.   It also doesn't matter whether or not ETI are operating any of a number of hypothesized high-energy nuclear technologies: natural sunlight reflected off artificial surfaces is sufficient.  Thus "Fermi bubbles", hypothetical regions of other galaxies to which an ETI civilization has spread, may be most readily recognized not by features recognizable to the human eye (in any nearby large galaxy, astronomers would already have discovered them), nor by determining what kinds of structures the ETI have constructed, but analyzing, often by exhaustive computer search, spectra of different regions in galaxies for the tell-tale signatures of engineered surfaces.
Here are some thougts about irreducible complexity and society. There's quite a bit more I could say about this, and some day I will. This is just a very brief introduction to what I've been thinking about for several years, and some tentative conclusions about it.Friedrich Hayek called the hubristic ideas of social scientists, that they could explain and plan the details of society (including economic production), their "fatal conceit." He informally analyzed the division of knowledge to explain why the wide variety of businesses in our economy cannot be centrally planned. "The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess." The economic problem is "a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality." Austrian economists like Hayek usually eschewed the use of traditional mathematics to describe the economy because such use assumes that economic complexities can be reduced to a small number of axioms.Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian economist and philosopher who discussed the use of knowledge in society.Modern mathematics, however -- in particular algorithmic information theory -- clarifies the limits of mathematical reasoning, including models with infinite numbers of axioms. The mathematics of irreducible complexity can be used to formalize the Austrians' insights. Here is an introduction to algorithmic information theory, and further thoughts on measuring complexity.Sometimes information comes in simple forms. The number 1, for example, is a simple piece of data. The number pi, although it has an infinite number of digits, is similarly simple, because it can be generated by a short finite algorithm (or computer program). That algorithm fully describes pi. However, a large random number has an irreducible complexity. Gregory Chaitin discovered a number, Chaitin's omega, which although it has a simple and clear definition (it's just a sum of probabilities that a random computer program will halt) has an irreducibly infinite complexity. Chaitin proved that there is no way to completely describe omega in a finite manner. Chaitin has thus shown that there is no way to reduce mathematics to a finite set of axioms. Any mathematical system based on a finite set of axioms (e.g. the system of simple algebra and calculus commonly used by non-Austrian economists) overly simplifies mathematical reality, much less social reality.Furthermore, we know that the physical world contains vast amounts of irreducible complexity. The quantum mechanics of chemistry, the Brownian motions of the atmosphere, and so on create vast amounts of uncertainty and locally unique conditions. Medicine, for example, is filled with locally unique conditions often known only very incompletely by one or a few hyperspecialized physicians or scientists.Ray Solomonoff and Gregory Chaitin, pioneers of algorithmic information theory.The strategic nature of the social world means that it will contain irreducible complexity even if the physical world of production and the physical needs of consumption were simple. We can make life open-endedly complicated for each other by playing penny matching games. Furthermore, shared information might be false or deceptively incomplete.Even if we were perfectly honest and altruistic with each other, we would still face economies of knowledge. A world of more diverse knowledge is far more valuable to us than a world where we all had the same skills and beliefs. This is the most important source of the irreducible complexity of knowledge: the wealthier we are, the greater the irreducibly complex amount of knowledge (i.e. diversity of knowledge) society has about the world and about itself. This entails more diversity of knowledge in different minds, and thus the greater difficulty of coordinating economic behavior.The vastness of the useful knowledge in the world is far greater than our ability to store, organize, and communicate that knowledge. One limitation is simply how much our brains can hold. There is far more irreducible and important complexity in the world than can be held in a single brain. For this reason, at least some of this omplexity is impossible to share between human minds.The channel capacity of human language and visual comprehension are further limited. This often makes it impossible to share irreducibly complex knowledge between human minds even if the mind could in theory store and comprehend that knowledge. The main barrier here is the inability to articulate tacit knowledge, rather than limitations of technology. However, the strategic and physical limits to reducing knowledge are of such vast proportions that most knowledge could not be fully shared even with ideal information technology. Indeed, economies of knowledge suggest that the proportion of knowledge would be even less widely shared in a very wealthy world of physically optimal computer and network technology than it is today -- although the absolute amount of knowledge shared would be far greater, the sum total of knowledge would be far greater still, and thus the proportion optimally shared would be smaller.The limitations on the distribution of knowledge, combined with the inexhaustible sources of irreducible complexity, mean that the wealthier we get, the greater the unique knowledge stored in each mind and shared with few others, and the smaller fraction of knowledge is available to any one mind. There are a far greater variety of knowledge "pigeons" which must be stuffed into the same brain "pigeonholes," and thus less room for "cloning pigeons" through mass media, mass education, and the like. Wealthier societies take greater advantage of long tails (i.e., they satisfy a greater variety of preferences) and thus become even less plannable than poorer societies that are still focused on simpler areas such as agriculture and Newtonian industry. More advanced societies increasingly focus on areas such as interpersonal behaviors (sales, law, etc.) and medicine (the complexity of the genetic code is just the tip of the iceberg; the real challenge is the irreducibly complex quantum effects of biochemistry, for example the protein folding problem). . Both interpersonal behaviors and medicine are areas where our demand is insatiable and supply is based on the internalization of vast irreducible complexity. This is not to say that further breakthroughs in simplifying the world from which we are supplied, such as those of Newtonian physics and the industrial revolution, are not possible; but to achieve them we will have to search through vastly larger haystacks. Furthermore, once these breakthroughs are made supply will become cheap and demand quickly satiated; then we will be back to trying to satisfy our higher-order and inexhaustible preferences using a supply of largely irreducible complexity.

For those of you who didn't catch me on econ-law a few months ago [2005] during the hurricanes, here is an expanded version of what I posted there:Here are some alternative ways of rationing in an emergency. At least some of these have been written about by Yoram Barzel. We have witnessed all of them during hurricane Katrina [and also this summer (2008) during Ivan]:(1) market prices ("price gouging")(2) waiting in line(3) centrally planned rationing(4) don't ration: just let the resource run outIt's not clear that, even with perfect knowledge, with or without an emrgency, centrally planned rationing could operate without using one of the other methods of rationing. In any case, our very poor knowledge about each others' needs is sufficient to ensure that, short of a perfect price system, we can't get what we want without waiting in line, and sometimes we just can't get what we want (or even, the Rolling Stones notwithstanding, what we need). The worse the price system -- in other words, the higher the transaction costs -- the more we wait in line or do without, as East Germany once demonstrated (cf. West Germany) and as North Korea continues to demonstrate. Luckily for those of us in largely market price based economies, we need only wait in line when trying to do business with the government, call a toll-free service line, go to a hot movie on opening night, or during an emergency -- i.e. in the remaining situations where prices don't operate very well or at all, due to transaction costs imposed by law or otherwise.Mises and Hayek long ago demonstrated the weakness of centrally planned economies such as the old Soviet Union (or today's North Korea) -- the lack of knowledge the government has about peoples' needs and desires. Similarly, lack of the requisite detailed rknowledge of the needs of others, especially at specific times of crisis when they need our help most, is a huge problem even if we were perfectly charitable. Not even the local governments exhibited much knowledge of the needs of their neighbors, especially in New Orleans. Much less did the state or Feds (FEMA being only the most glaring example) exhibit even a tiny fraction of the knowledge that would be required for an optimal outcome. This is not the fault of the people in the government agencies to not act as knowlegeably as they are capable of acting, but rather the fault is in their implied promises and our expectations. For example, TV commentators, watching pictures of some Coast Guard helicopters, seem to have come to expect that government agencies will swoop down from the sky and rescue everybody and take on other attributes of God. Such as, for example, being able to knowledgeably evacuate people and distribute other scarce goods and services in a disaster.Per Mises and Hayek, even if the Soviet Union had been run by an perfectly beneficient dictator, people would have, short of a matching omniscience of said dictator (and of enough of his underlings to receive and act on the knowledge) still have waited in bread lines. When price controls hit gasoline in the United States in the 1970s, people similarly waited in gas lines.In emergencies rationing becomes extreme: people wait in long lines, pay "extortionate" prices, or, even worse, do without. We are thrown into economically unfamiliar territory and transaction costs balloon. Goods will always be rationed in one or more of the above four ways, and in an emergency the rationing can be quite severe. Our charitable spirit can temporarily overcome self-interest, but it can't overcome the knowledge problem or the scarcity of goods.Given that waiting in line, or doing without, are very painful (even sometimes deadly) alternatives, and that allowing the charge of very high prices can largely prevent use of these extreme and wasteful forms of rationing, why do we have price gouging laws?Can price gouging laws be explained as follows? In a zero transaction cost world, consumers would successfully negotiate with retailers for an insurance policy that caps prices in case of emergency. This may be, for example, because retailers are better able to bear the risk of emergency supply shortages than consumers are, or because consumers don't want to bear the risk of having to have an unusually large amount of money at hand during an emergency. (Katrina may be a good example of this -- it reportedly struck just before many paychecks were due, leaving many people who live from paycheck to paycheck without funds). However, the transaction costs for negotiating with consumers for such contracts are too high. Therefore, the default retail sales contract should include such insurance. Price gouging laws are a convenient way to do this. More generally, if it weren't such a bother almost all of us would like to purchase insurance against volatile prices in order to make our budgets more predictable.Whether and when wholesale contracts include such price caps provisions would provide interesting evidence in favor of or against this hypothesis, and under what conditions it would have been rational to for consumers and retailers to have made such a contract.As we have seen, there is a strong economic argument against price gouging laws. Consistent application of market pricing during an emergency would minimize the other inefficient, and occasionally deadly, rationing methods above, especially (4)actually running out of emergency supplies. Consumers could be confident that supplies will not run out, so stocking up on excess supplies based on fear of imminently running out of the supply (such as we've seen consumers do in some areas recently with gasoline) would be minimized. Given modern technology, perhaps we should work on improving the availability of credit and liquidity in emergencies via always-up wireless devices and immediately payable liquidity insurance policies instead of price gouging laws.Furthermore, the promise of very high prices might motivate retailers to fly in special deliveries of emergency supplies at otherwise prohibitive transportation rates. On can even imagine for-profit organizations doing many of the tasks that the National Guard, Red Cross, and similar organizations are doing now. Of course, the moral indignation would be enormous. People, at least in political discussion, tend to be extremely averse to "windfall profits" and seem to have a strong psychological preference for an implicit insurance policy that puts a price cap during emergencies on retail contracts.
The D.C. Circuit held today that the definition of "income" in the Sixteenth Amendment does not include "damages received solely in compensation for a personal injury." More generally, a "restoration of capital" is not income, nor is “a substitute for [a] normally untaxed personal ... quality, good, or ‘asset’." If it's not income, and it's not taxable elsewhere in the Constitution (which severely limits the federal power to tax), then the federal government may not tax it, regardless of what Congress or the IRS say.Because of the "sanctity of property" (what a refreshing phrase to read in a federal court case!), the court says it cannot defer to Congress to define what constitutes "income" and thus what is taxable under the Sixteenth Amendment. Thus, even though the Internal Revenue Code excludes from the income tax only compensation “received ... on account of personal physical injuries," compensation for emotional and reputational injuries is not "income," therefore not taxable. A good application, I'd say, of charter-based law and the principle of least authority (more commonly known in this context as the principle of enumerated powers, as opposed to the scheme of unenumerated rights per the Ninth amendment).One interesting objection that may be raised by the IRS on appeal is that even if "restoration of capital" and compensatiion for "normally untaxed personal...asset[s]" are not taxable under the Sixteenth Amendment, they may under some circumstances (including non-physical personal injuries) be taxable under the original Constitutional grant of the power to tax to Congress. This gets us into the old argument over proportionment, direct taxation and the income tax that was current during the years before the enactment of the Sixteenth.The grant of tax power to Congress under Article I severely limits direct taxes: "direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers." (A. 1, S. 2, C. 3). This language would have to be quite severely twisted (as it unfortunately was in some late nineteenth century cases, though not this far) to fit in a direct tax on compensation, since such a tax is not apportioned among the states according to their population, but rather is apportioned according to the amount of the compensation. That's why they passed the Sixteenth Amendment in the first place: because the Court back then would not stretch the language far enough to include a general income tax. The principle of least authority, via the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, strongly urges judges who read the Constitution thoughtfully to not interpret the necessarily concise language of the enumerated powers to include more power than ratifiers intended to grant.The opinion was written by Douglas Ginsburg, one of my favorite judges.
When you call Cingular customer service, the customer representative you talk to learns your value to the company via this handy meter. You may or may not be eligible for various discount offers, depending on how much business you've done with the company in the past (life time value) and whether they expect you to stay with them in the future (churn potential). Churn potential is perhaps based on how hard it would be for you to switch to a competitor. Many companies track data related to these two variables, but this widget distills it all down for the operator you talk to.Hat tip to Marginal Revolution.
Under the first sale rule, a patented or copyrighted work can be resold without the permission of the patent or copyright holder. For example, if you buy a book you can give it away or resell it without getting permission from the publisher, even if the book contains a copyright notice that purports to forbid this. Similarly, if you buy a patented widget, you can generally resell it without the permission or against the objections of the patent owner. The first sale is said to exhaust the rights of the patent holder over that object.The Federal Circuit court in the United States has held that for patents the first sale rule does not apply to copies, including seeds based on purchase of the parent seed:The fact that a patented technology can replicate itself does not give a purchaser the right to use replicated copies of the technology. Applying the first sale doctrine to subsequent generations of self-replicating technology would eviscerate the rights of the patent holder.Furthermore, the Federal Circuit held that the farmer had no implied license to use the daughter seeds, because Monsanto's license to the wholesaler restricted this use and "a seller cannot confer broader rights via an implied license than it has been granted by the patent holder."This latter is based on a general principle of the common law of property: you can't grant more than you own. There is an interesting exception to this principle for financial property (negotiable instruments).The idea at work here might be called a conservation of property rights: you can't sell what you don't own and you can't take back what you have sold. It is a sensible principle that greatly simplifies the legal relationships we have with each other. However, this case, and some other recent cases providing for exceptions to the first sale rule, seems to give rise to a new and odd violation of rights conservation. A patent owner can lose its rights over an object, but later they can re-appear again. Here, the patent owner Monsanto lost its residual rights of control over the seeds when it sold them, via the first sale doctrine. But then, when the farmer grew the seeds and planted the daughter seeds, the patent owner's rights suddently re-appeared.For the case of seeds, this paradox can be resolved by treating the daughter seeds as separate objects from the parent seeds. Under this view, what the farmer was doing was the equivalent of manufacturing new widgets rather than simply repairing the same widget (which would not require the patent owner's permission under U.S. law).A more disturbing violation of rights conservation occurs in the issue of national versus international first sale exhaustion. Many countries have a simple rule: the first sale of an object by a patent owner anywhere in the world exhausts that owner's patents covering the object in that country. This was also the view in the majority of federal circuit courts in the U.S. before creation of the Federal Circuit and its monopoly over patent law.Earlier this year the Federal Ciruit in the Jazz Photo took a different view. Now if you buy, for example, a widget in Japan, paying royalties to the Japanese patent owner in Japan, and then export the widget to the U.S., you still need permission of the U.S. patent owner (usually the very same person with the same kinds of patent claims as the Japanse patent owner). The patent owner's rights over that object disappear upon first sale in Japan but magically re-appear when the object crosses the border into the U.S. This can only be reconciled with conservation of rights by the idea that that the Japanese patent is a different property right than the United States patent, even though they are owned by the same person and protect the same invention. It is as if you drove your car from Virginia to Maryland and the dealer you bought it from came along and repossessed it, because your Virginia title did not give you Maryland title. That would be a very strange and unfortunate world. It is far simpler, and makes for much more secure property rights, to treat property rights as universally conserved even though they are titled by a local authority.
 Jacob C. Horberger has a great article on how Hitler became a dictator in a democracy. A key point came with the Reichstag fire, in which the German capitol building was burned down by a communist terrorist:"The day after the [Reichstag] fire, Hitler persuaded President Hindenburg to issue a decree entitled, 'For the Protection of the People and the State.' Justified as a “defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state,” the decree suspended the constitutional guarantees pertaining to civil liberties..."Specifically Hindenburg (not Hitler) declared that the government could restrcit civil liberties "beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed." This was the first step to dictatorship, the Reichstag Fire Decree. The second step was the Enabling Act, which destroyed separation of powers by giving the executive branch legislative power. It was only supposed to be temporary, until the government had dealt with the terrorist threat.This was hardly the only time in history a republic or democracy has been converted by a perceived or actual emergency or war into a dictatorship. The examples are numerous, but perhaps two more major ones suffice: the 1917 October Revolution destroyed the shaky parliamentary government of Kerensky with the dictatorship of Lenin. Dispute over the legal powers of officials and ensuing civil war turned the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.
I've noticed that there are strong parallels between accounting and two important areas of mathematics -- the elementary algebra and the calculus. I suspect these reflect the origins of algebra in accounting and origins of some of the basic concepts behind the calculus in accounting. Readily available references to the history of accounting and mathematics may be too scant to prove it, but I think the parallels are quite suggestive.A basic parallel between accounting and algebra is the balance metaphor. The origin of this metaphor was almost surely the balance scale, an ancient commercial tool for measuring the weight of precious metals and other commodities. Standard weights would be added or removed from the scale until balance with the commodity to be weighed was achieved.Starting with the "accounting equation," assets = liabilities + equity, the strategy of accounting as with algebra is to achieve numerical balance by filling in missing quantities. As far back as the Sumerians the need for balance in accounting was widely understood, but it was expressed either in purely verbal or purely ledger form rather than with an algebraic notation.(Simarily, logic was expressed in standard language rather than with its own abstract symbolic notation until Gottleib Frege in the 19th century). Furthermore, examples of algebraic work left by the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Indians, and indeed up to the time of Fibonacci and Pacioli, typically involved accounting problems.Calculus largely has its origins in the study of change and how a dynamic view of the world relates to a static view of the world. Newton called calculus the study of "fluxions," or units of change. (This is a more descriptive label for the field than "calculus" which simply means "calculating stone" and has been used to refer to a wide variety of areas of mathematics and logic). Long before Newton, the relationship between the static and the dynamic was probably first conceptualized as the relationship between the balance sheet and the income statement. The balance sheet, which can be summarized asassets = liabilities + equityis the "integral" of the income statement which can be summarized asrevenues = expenses + net income(in other words, the income statement is the "derivative" of the balance sheet: the change in the balance sheet over a specific period of time).Earlier civilizations had only mapped large scales of time to a spatial visualization in the form of a calendar. Diaries and accounting ledgers ordered by time also crudely map time into space. The sundial mapped time into space, but in a distorted manner. Medieval Europeans with the invention of the mechanical clock and of musical notation including rhythm expanded and systematized the mapping of time to a spatial visualization with consistent units. William of Occam and other Scholastics visualized time as a spatial dimension and other phenomena (including temperature, distance, and moral qualities) as orthogonal dimensions to be graphed against time. Occam then used methods of Archimedes to calculate absolute quantities from the area under such curves, but we awaited Newton and Leibniz, building on the analytical geometry of DesCartes, which systematically related algebraic equations to spatial curves, to create a systematic calculus. Earlier in India, the algebra and much of the differential calculus were also developed within or alongside a rich business culture in which bookeeping using "Arabic" numerals (also invented in Inda) was also widespread. I conclude that the conceptual apparatus behind much traditional mathematics originated in commercial accounting techniques.A big exception to this is geometry. Geometry developed primarily from the need to define property rights in the largest form of wealth from the neolithic until quite recently, namely farmland, but that is another blog post for another day.
In common English, "or" and "and" are often ambiguous.  "Or" can mean either inclusive or exclusive or, among other things.  "And" often means set union, which might correspond to either inclusive or exclusive "or" or logical "and." For example, "choose from a box containing X and Y" might mean "choose X or Y" (inclusive), "choose  X or Y" (exclusive), or "choose X and Y" -- depending on whether you get to choose once, once or twice, or you must make two choices.  There are any number of other ambiguities that arise when trying to deduce the logic, if any, behind many plain English uses of "and" and "or."Nevertheless, it's not hard for a legal drafter to make the logic of a legal document clear. This should be Legal Drafting 101, a class which should be required in all law schools: use "X or Y, but not both" for exclusive or, "X or Y, or both" for inclusive or, "both X and Y" for logical and.  It would probably save billions of dollars and many erroneous decisions per year if lawyers followed these three simple drafting tips.   For that matter, technical writers and any other writers trying to make logical relationships clear might benefit from this advice.Link here for a hilarious thread of some of America's smartest lawyers trying to decipher a Supreme Court opinion and decide whether it breaks one of De Morgan's Laws --  not (A or B) = not A and not B (where the "or" is inclusive).  It may depend on what the meaning of "or" is.
In the middle of the Darby century came the important decision of Miller v. Race.  Surprisingly, no copy of this case is to be found online save in the syllabus of Professor Gregory Maggs.  So with his permission I've appended his edited version of the case (with some additional very minor edits of my own) below.Negotiable instruments – checks, bank notes, and so on – are promises to pay or orders with an implied promise to pay, and are thus contracts.  But they differ from contracts in two important ways.   First is the idea of “merger.”  Normally, a contract right is an abstraction that is located nowhere in particular but belongs to a party to the contract or to a person to whom that party has assigned that right.  Possessing a copy of a normal contract has nothing to do with who has rights under that contract. But in a negotiable instrument, the contract right is “merged” into the document.  Assignment of that right takes place simply by transferring the document (in the case of a bearer instrument) or by indorsing (signing) and transferring it.  The second big way negotiable instruments differ from contracts is the “good faith purchaser” or “holder in due course” rule which is illustrated by Miller v. Race.  In a normal sale of goods under common law, the new owner’s title to the goods is at risk to the contractual defenses of a prior owner.  For example: Alice is Dr. Barb’s patient and is feeling ill.  Barb  says to Alice, “sell me your Mercedes for $100 and you’ll feel a lot better.”  Alice complies, but then later realizes she was snookered.  Meanwhile, Barb sells the car to Chuck, who knows nothing of how Barb acquired it, for $50,000.  Under contract law, Chuck can get no greater title to the car than Barb had.   But the contract is void for undue influence, so Barb doesn’t have legal title to the car.  Ergo, Chuck does not, either.  Alice can sue Chuck to get her car back.   Chuck must then sue Barb for his $50,000, an expensive and often-futile thing to do.Contract defenses are invoked so commonly that any downstream owner of a good is at significant title risk under common law.  This risk could make things very bad for paper money, which to work efficiently should change hands dozens of times or more. Thus, Miller v. Race has long been celebrated as an advance that made bank notes under the common law a more efficient form of money.  Miller helped create for promissory notes under common law (including, crucially, bank notes) what is now known as the “good faith purchaser” or “holder in due course” rule.  Summarized, this rule says that a holder in due course who obtained the instrument for value, in good faith, and without notice of any upstream claims or defenses, is entitled to enforce the promise to pay in that instrument regardless of most kinds of such claims or defenses.The good faith purchaser rule can cause its own problems.  For example, when you sign a promissory note to get a mortgage, these days the bank usually sells that note to an aggregator, who bundle up these mortgage notes in packages and sell them to investors.  In most states if you make your mortgage payments to Bank A, who has meanwhile sold the mortgage to Bank B (and perhaps not told you), Bank B can bill you for that same payment and foreclose on your house if you don't pay.  You have to pay Bank B and then beg, plead, or sue Bank A to get your money back.Today, the differences between negotiable instrument law and contract law are sufficient that negotiable instruments and sale of goods are in different and largely distinct sections of the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code.Mr. Race was a clerk at the Bank of England who refused to pay on demand when Miller presented the Bank’s note.  Miller was an innkeeper who had unknowingly taken the note as payment from a lodger who had stolen the note from the mails.  Forthwith, Miller v. Race:Miller v. RaceCourt of King’s Bench1 Burr. 452, 97 Eng. Rep. 398 (K.B. 1758)It was an action of trover against the defendant, upon a bank note, for the payment of twenty-one pounds ten shillings to one William Finney or bearer, on demand.The cause came on to be tried before Lord Mansfield at the sittings in Trinity term last at Guildhall, London and upon the trial it appeared that William Finney, being possessed of this bank note on the 11th of December 1756, sent it by the general post, under cover, directed to one Bernard Odenharty, at Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire; that on the same night the mail was robbed, and the bank note in question (amongst other notes) taken and carried away by the robber; that this bank note, on the 12th of the same December, came into the hands and possession of the plaintiff, for a full and valuable consideration, and in the usual course and way of his business, and without any notice or knowledge of this bank note being taken out of the mail. It was admitted and agreed, that, in the common and known course of trade, bank notes are paid by and received of the holder or possessor of them, as cash; and that in the usual way of negotiating bank notes, they pass from one person to another as cash, by delivery only and without any further inquiry or evidence of title, than what arises from the possession. It appeared that Mr. Finney, having notice of this robbery, on the 13th December, applied to the Bank of England, “to stop the payment of this note:” which was ordered accordingly, upon Mr. Finney’s entering into proper security “to indemnify the bank.”Some little time after this, the plaintiff applied to the bank for the payment of this note; and for that purpose delivered the note to the defendant, who is a clerk in the bank: but the defendant refused either to pay the note, or to re-deliver it to the plaintiff. Upon which this action was brought against the defendant.The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and the sum of 21l. 10s. damages, subject nevertheless to the opinion of this Court upon this question—“Whether under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff had a sufficient property in this bank note, to entitle him to recover in the present action?”* * *Sir Richard Lloyd, for the defendant.The present action is brought, not for the money due upon the note; but for the note itself, the paper, the evidence of the debt. So that the right to the money is not the present question: the note is only an evidence of the money’s being due to him as bearer.  The note must either come to the plaintiff by assignment; or must be considered as if the bank gave a fresh, separate, and distinct note to each bearer. Now the plaintiff can have no right by the assignment of a robber. And the bank cannot be considered as giving a new note to each bearer: though each bearer may be considered as having obtained from the bank a new promise.I do not say whether the bank can, or cannot stop payment; that is another question. But the note is only an instrument of recovery.  Now this note, or these goods (as I may call it,) was the property of Mr. Finney, who paid in the money: he is the real owner. It is like a medal which might entitle a man to payment of money, or to any other advantage. And it is by Mr. Finney’s authority and request that Mr. Race detained it.  It may be objected, that this note is to be considered as cash “in the usual course of trade.” But still, the course of trade is not at all affected by the present question, about the right to the note. A different species of action must be brought for the note, from what must be brought against the bank for the money. And this man has elected to bring trover for the note itself, as owner of the note; and not to bring his action against the bank for the money. In which action of trover, property can not be proved in the plaintiff: for a special proprietor can have no right against the true owner.* * *Mr. Williams contra for the plaintiff.The holder of this bank note, upon a valuable consideration has a right to it, even against the true owner.1st, the circulation of these notes vests a property in the holder, who comes to the possession of it, upon a valuable consideration.2dly, this is of vast consequence to trade and commerce; and they would be greatly incommoded if it were otherwise.3dly, this falls within the reason of a sale in market-overt; and ought to be determined upon the same principle.* * *Lord Mansfield now delivered the resolution of the Court.After stating the case at large, he declared that at the trial, he had no sort of doubt, but this action was well brought, and would lie against the defendant in the present case; upon the general course of business, and from the consequences to trade and commerce: which would be much incommoded by a contrary determination.It has been very ingeniously argued by Sir Richard Lloyd for the defendant. But the whole fallacy of the argument turns upon comparing bank notes to what they do not resemble, and what they ought not to be compared to, viz. to goods, or to securities, or documents for debts.  Now they are not goods, not securities, nor documents for debts, nor are so esteemed: but are treated as money, as cash, in the ordinary course and transaction of business, by the general consent of mankind; which gives them the credit and currency of money, to all intents and purposes. They are as much money, as guineas themselves are; or any other current coin, that is used in common payments, as money or cash.* * *Here, an inn-keeper took it, bonâ fide, in his business from a person who made an appearance of a gentleman. Here is no pretence or suspicion of collusion with the robber: for this matter was strictly inquired and examined into at the trial; and is so stated in the case, “that he took it for a full and valuable consideration, in the usual course of business.” Indeed if there had been any collusion, or any circumstances of unfair dealing; the case had been much otherwise. If it had been a note for 1000l. it might have been suspicious: but this was a small note for 21l. 10s. only: and money given in exchange for it.* * *A bank-note is constantly and universally, both at home and abroad, treated as money, as cash; and paid and received, as cash; and it is necessary, for the purposes of commerce, that their currency should be established and secured.* * *Lord Mansfield declared that the Court were all of the same opinion, for the plaintiff; and that Mr. Just. Wilmot concurred.
When my old employer the Jet Propulsion Laboratory slammed a 370 kilogram projectile into comet Tempel 1, it caused the release of at least 250,000,000 kilograms of water from the comet over a period of two weeks, according to the BBC. The peak rate occurred at 5 days, and it's a reasonably continuous flow. This suggests a variation on my ice rocket manufacturing technique: instead of going to all that work to extract, liquify, distill, and then freeze water from the frozen mudball, just make this kind of coma (something like a vapor geyser) and put the slowly rotating and shaded cylinder forms in the path of the coma. One probably has to tether the cylinders to the comet to keep them from blowing away, and I haven't worked out what the best distance from the comet surface is, or indeed if the deposition rate on the forms will be fast enough at a safe distance (deposition from gas is a different regime from the freezing spheres I proposed in 1992). Also the comet throws off carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases with the water, and the vapor carries some dust, so it's unknown whether the purity of the deposited ice will be sufficient to avoid overly rapid corrosion of the thermal ("steam") rocket. But the economics are potentially quite attractive so it's worth looking into. The basic economic advantage of rockets using native ice as the propellant source is that (once we've moved the ice to the starting orbits of our desired journeys) they save not only on the expensive launch of propellant from earth, but also on most of the remaining mass one must now launch out of earth's vast gravity well, namely propellant tanks. The BBC Tempel 1 story comes via Emergent Chaos.
Ian Grigg has a good article on the the investigation involving e-gold(tm). Here is a letter from e-gold's Doug Jackson. Note that e-gold, like e-cash, PayPal, etc. is a trusted third party payment system, and thus very different from bit gold. Unlike most payment systems, however, e-gold is its own currency, fixed to the value of gold.
Here is a modified excerpt from A Measure of Sacrifice:Mechanical clocks, bell towers, and sandglasses, a combination invented in 13th century Italy, provided the world’s first fair and fungible measure of sacrifice.  So many of the things we sacrifice for are not fungible, but we can arrange our affairs around the measurement of the sacrifice rather than its results.  Merchants and workers alike used the new precision of clock time to prove, brag, and complain about their sacrifices.In a letter from a fourteenth-century Italian merchant to his wife, Francesco di Marco Ganti invokes the new hours tell her of the sacrifices he is making:  “tonight, in the twenty-third hour, I was called to the college,” and, “I don’t have any time, it is the twenty-first hour and I have had nothing to eat or drink.” [4]   Like many cell phone callers today, he wants to reassure her that he is spending the evening working, not wenching.A major application of clocks was to schedule meeting times.   Being a city official was an expected sacrifice as well as a source of political power.   To measure the sacrifice, as well as to coordinate more tightly meeting times, the modern clocks of the fourteenth century came in handy.   Some regulations of civic meetings of this period point up that that measuring the sacrifice was important, regardless of the variable output of the meetings.  In Nuremburg, the Commission of Five “had to observe the sworn minimum meeting time of four “or” (hours) per day, regardless of whether or not they had a corresponding workload. They were also obliged to supervise their own compliance by means of a sandglass.[4]As commerce grew, more quantities needed their value to be measured, leading to more complications and more opportunities for fraud. Measurement disputes become too frequent when measuring too many quantities.  Measuring something that actually indicates value is difficult.  Measuring something that indicates value and immune to spoofing is very difficult.  Labor markets did not come easily but are the result of a long evolution in how we measure value.Most workers in the modern economy earn money based on a time rate -- the hour, the day, the week, or the month.   In agricultural societies slavery, serfdom, and piece rates were more common than time-rate wages.   Time measures input rather than output.   Our most common economic relationship, employment, arranges our affairs around the measurement of the sacrifice rather than its results.To create anything of value requires some sacrifice.   To successfully contract we must measure value.   Since we can’t, absent a perfect exchange market, directly measure the economic value of something, we may be able to estimate it indirectly by measuring something else.   This something else anchors the performance – it gives the performer an incentive to optimize the measured value.  Which measures are the most appropriate anchors of performance?   Starting in Europe by the 13th century, that measure was increasingly a measure of the sacrifice needed to create the desired economic value. Actual opportunity costs are very hard to measure, but at least for labor we have a good proxy measure[14] of the opportunities lost by working -- time. This is why paying somebody per hour (or per month while noticing how often a worker is around the office) is so very common. It's far cheapr to measure time, thus estimating the worker's opportunity costs, than actual value of output. Time as a proxy measure for worker value is hardly automatic – labor is not value. A bad artist can spend years doodling, or a worker can dig a hole where nobody wants a hole.   Arbitrary amounts of time could be spent on activities that do not have value for anybody except, perhaps, the worker himself. To improve the productivity of the time rate contract required two breakthroughs: the first, creating the conditions under which sacrifice is a better estimate of value than piece rate or other measurement alternatives, and second, the ability to measure, with accuracy and integrity, the sacrifice.Three of the main alternatives to time-rate wages are eliminating worker choice (i.e., serfdom and slavery), commodity market exchange, and piece rates.  When eliminating choice, masters and lords imposed high exit costs, often in the form of severe punishments for escape, shirking, or embezzlement.   Serfs were usually required to produce a particular quantity of a good (where the good can be measured, as it often can in agriculture) to be expropriated by the lord or master.   Serfs kept for their personal use (not for legal trade) either a percentage or the marginal output, i.e. the output above and beyond what they owed, by custom or coercion, to their lord.  Where quantity was not a good measure of value, close observation and control were kept over the laborer, and the main motivator was harsh punishments for failure.   High exit costs also provided the lord with a longer-term relationship, thus over time the serf or slave might develop a strong reputation for trustworthiness with the lord.  The undesirability of servitude, from the point of view of the laborer at least, is obvious.   Serfs and slaves faced brutal work conditions, floggings, starvation, very short life spans, and the inability to escape no matter how bad conditions got.  Piece rates measure directly some attribute of a good or service that is important to its value – its quantity, weight, volume, or the like -- and then fix a price for it.   Guild regulations which fixed prices often amounted to creating piece rates.  Piece rates seem the ideal alternative for liberating workers, but they suffer for two reasons.   First, the outputs of labor depend not only on effort, skills, etc. (things under control of the employee), but things out of control of the employee.   The employee wants something like insurance against these vagaries of the work environment.   The employer, who has more wealth and knowledge of market conditions, takes on these risks in exchange for profit.In an unregulated commodity market, buyers can reject or negotiate downwards the price of poor quality goods.   Sellers can negotiate upwards or decline to sell.   With piece rate contracts, on the other hand, there is a fixed payment for a unit of output.  Thus second main drawback to piece rates is that they motivate the worker to put out more quantity at the expense of quality.     This can be devastating.   The tendency of communist countries to pay piece rates, rather than hourly rates, is one reason that, while the Soviet bloc’s quantity (and thus the most straightforward measurements of economic growth) was able to keep up with the West, quality did not (thus the contrast, for example, between the notoriously ugly and unreliable Trabant of East Germany and the BMWs, Mercedes, Audi and Volkswagens of West Germany).Thus with the time-rate wage the employee is insured against vagaries of production beyond his control, including selling price fluctuations (in the case of a market exchange), or variation in the price or availability of factors of production (in the case of both market exchange or piece rates).   The employer takes on these risks, while at the same time through promotion, raises, demotions, wage cuts or firing retaining incentives for quality employee output.   Besides lacking implicit insurance for the employee, another limit to market purchase of each worker’s output is that it can be made prohibitively costly by relationship-specific investments.   These investments occur when workers engage in interdependent production -- as the workers learn the equipment or adapt to each other.    Relationship-specific investments can also occur between firms, for example building a cannon foundry next to an iron mine.  These investments, when combine with the inability to write long-term contracts that account for all eventualities, motivate firms to integrate.   Dealing with unspecified eventualities then becomes the right of the single owner.   This incentive to integrate is opposed by the diseconomies of scale in a bureaucracy, caused by the distribution of knowledge, which market exchange handles much better [13].   An in-depth discussion of  economic tradeoffs that produce observed distributions of firm sizes in a market, i.e. the number of workers involved in an employment relationship instead of selling their wares directly or working for smaller firms,  has been discussed in [11,12]The main alternative to market exchange of output, piece rate, or coerced labor (serfdom or slavery) consists of the employers paying by sacrifice -- by some measure of the desirable things the employee foregoes to pursue the employer’s objectives.   An hour spent at work is an hour not spent partying, playing with the children, etc.  For labor, this “opportunity cost” is most easily denominated in time – a day spent working for the employer is a day not spent doing things the employee would, if not for the pay, desire to do. [1,9]   Time doesn’t specify costs such as effort and danger.   These have to be taken into account by an employee or his union when evaluating a job offer.  Worker choice, through the ability to switch jobs at much lower costs than with serfdom, allows this crucial quality control to occur.It’s usually hard to specify customer preferences, or quality, in a production contract.   It’s easy to specify sacrifice, if we can measure it.  Time is immediately observed; quality is eventually observed.   With employment via a time-wage, the costly giving up of other opportunities, measured in time, can be directly motivated (via daily or hourly wages), while quality is motivated in a delayed, discontinuous manner (by firing if employers and/or peers judge that quality of the work is too often bad).  Third parties, say the guy who owned the shop across the street, could observe the workers arriving and leaving, and tell when they did so by the time.  Common synchronization greatly reduced the opportunities for fraud involving that most basic contractual promise, the promise of time.   Once pay for time is in place, the basic incentives are in place – the employee is, verifiably, on the job for a specific portion of the day – so he might as well work.  He might as well do the work, both quantity and quality, that the employer requires.   With incentives more closely aligned by the calendar and the city bells measuring the opportunity costs of employment, to be compensated by the employer, the employer can focus observations on verifying the specific quantity and qualities desired, and the employee (to gain raises and avoid getting fired) focuses on satisfying them.   So with the  time-wage contract, perfected by northern and western Europeans in the late Middle Ages, we have two levels of the protocol in this relationship: (1) the employee trades away other opportunities to commit his time to the employer – this time is measured and compensated, (2)  the employer is motivated, by (positively) opportunities for promotions and wage rate hikes and (negatively) by the threat of firing, to use that time, otherwise worthless to both employer and employee, to achieve the quantity and/or quality goals desired by the employer.[1]References:[1] A good discussion of time-wage vs. piece-rate vs. other kinds of employment contracts can be found in McMillan, Games, Strategies, and Managers, Oxford University Press 1992[4] My main source for clocks and their impact is Dohrn-van Rossum, History of the Hour – Clocks and Modern Temporal Orders, University of Chicago Press, 1996.[9]  The original sources for much of the time rate contract discussion is Seiler, Eric (1984) “Piece rate vs. Time Rate: The Effect of Incentives on Earnings”, Review of Economics and Statistics 66: 363-76 and Ehrenberg, Ronald G., editor (1990) “Do Compensation Policies Matter?”, Special Issue of Indsturial and Labor Relations Review 43: 3-S-273-S[11] Coase, R.H., The Firm, the Market and the Law, University of Chicago Press 1988[12] Williamson, Oliver, The Economic Institutions of Capitalism, Free Press 1985[13] Hayek, Friedrich, "The Use of Knowledge In Society"[14] The insight that we measure value via proxy measures is due to Yoram Barzel.

That puzzle is called a proof-of-work,because the sole output of the computation is just a proof that the computerdid a costly computation. Bitcoin’s puzzle-solving hardware probably consumesin total over 500 megawatts of electricity. And that is not the only feature of Bitcoin that strikes an engineer orbusinessman who is focused on minimizing resource costs as highly quixotic. Ratherthan reduce its protocol messages to be as few as possible, eachBitcoin-running computer sprays the Internet with a redundantly large number of“inventory vector” packets to make very sure that all messages get accurately throughto as many other Bitcoin computers as possible. As a result, the Bitcoin blockchain cannot process as many transactions per second as atraditional payment network such as PayPal or Visa. Bitcoin offends thesensibilities of resource-conscious and performance-measure-maximizingengineers and businessmen alike.Instead, the secret toBitcoin’s success is that its prolific resource consumption and poorcomputational scalability is buying something even more valuable: socialscalability. Social scalability is the ability of an institution –- arelationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedlyparticipate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain ormotivate participants’ behaviors -- to overcome shortcomings in human minds andin the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who orhow many can successfully participate. Socialscalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think aboutand respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbersof participants in those institutions or relationships grow.  It's abouthuman limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resourceconstraints. There are separate engineering disciplines, such ascomputer science, for assessing the physical limitations of a technology itself,including the resource capacities needed for a technology to handle a greaternumber of users or a greater rate of use. Those engineering scalabilitydisciplines are not, except by way of contrast with social scalability, thesubject of this essay.Even though social scalabilityis about the cognitive limitations and behavior tendencies of minds, not aboutthe physical resource limitations of machines, it makes eminent sense, andindeed is often crucial, to think and talk about the social scalability of atechnology that facilitates an institution. The social scalability of aninstitutional technology depends on how that technology constrains or motivatesparticipation in that institution, including protection of participants and theinstitution itself from harmful participation or attack.  One way to estimate the social scalability ofan institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficiallyparticipate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is bythe extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants,before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harmsof participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits.  The cultural and jurisdictional diversity ofpeople who can beneficially participate in an institution is also oftenimportant, especially in the global Internet context. The more an institutiondepends on local laws, customs, or language, the less socially scalable it is.Without institutional andtechnological innovations of the past, participation in shared human endeavorswould usually be limited to at most about 150 people – the famous “Dunbar number”.  In the Internet era, new innovations continueto scale our social capabilities. In this article I will discuss howblockchains, and in particular public blockchains that implementcryptocurrencies, increase social scalability, even at a dreadful reduction incomputational efficiency and scalability.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;}Cognitive capacity – here in the form of the relative size of aspecies’ neocortex – set limits on how large primate groups can be.  Maintaining animal or intimate human groupsrequires extensive emotional communications and investments in relationships,such as grooming in primates and gossiping, humor, story-telling, and otherconversations, songs, and play in traditional human groups.

The precise opposite is the case.Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which wecan perform without thinking about them." Friedrich Hayek added: “We makeconstant use of formulas, symbols, and rules whose meaning we do not understandand through the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledgewhich individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices andinstitutions by building upon habits and institutions which have provedsuccessful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation ofthe civilization we have built up.”  A widevariety of innovations reduce our vulnerability to fellow participants, intermediaries,and outsiders, and thereby lower our need to spend our scarce cognitivecapacities worrying about how an increasingly large number of increasinglydiverse people might behave. Another class of improvements motivates theaccurate collection and transmission of valuable information between anincreasing number and variety of participants. Yet other advances enable awider number or variety of mutually beneficial participants can discover eachother.  All these kinds of innovations haveover the course of human prehistory and history improved social scalability,sometimes dramatically so, making our modern civilization with its vast globalpopulation feasible. Modern information technology (IT), especially by makinguse of the historically recent discoveries of computer science, can oftendiscover many more mutually beneficial matches, can improve motivations forinformation quality, and can reduce the need for trust within certain kinds ofinstitutional transactions, with respect to an increasingly large number andvariety of people, thereby further increasing social scalability in some very importantways.Information flows between minds– what I have called intersubjective protocols – include spoken and written words, custom (tradition), the contents of law(its rules, customs, and case precedents), a variety of other symbols (e.g.“star” ratings common in online reputation systems), and market prices, among many others.Trust minimization is reducingthe vulnerability of participants to each other’s and to outsiders’ andintermediaries’ potential for harmful behavior.  Most institutions which have undergone alengthy cultural evolution, such as law (which lowers vulnerability toviolence, theft, and fraud), as well as technologies of security, reduce, onbalance, and in more ways than the reverse, our vulnerabilities to, and thusour needs to trust, our fellow humans, compared with our vulnerabilities beforethese institutions and technologies evolved. In most cases an often trusted andsufficiently trustworthy institution (such as a market) depends on itsparticipants trusting, usually implicitly, another sufficiently trustworthyinstitution (such as contract law). These trusted institutions in turn traditionallyimplement a variety of accounting, legal, security, or other controls that makethem usually and sufficiently, at least for facilitating the functionality oftheir client institutions, trustworthy, by minimizing vulnerability to their ownparticipants (such as accountants, lawyers, regulators, and investigators). Aninnovation can only partially take away some kinds of vulnerability, i.e.reduce the need for or risk of trust in other people. There is no such thing asa fully trustless institution or technology. The nonexistence of completetrustlessness is true even of our strongest security technology, encryption. Althoughsome cryptographic protocols do guarantee certain specific data relationships withastronomically high probability against opponents with astronomically highcomputing power, they do not provide complete guarantees when accounting forall possible behaviors of all participants. For example, encryption canstrongly protect an e-mail from direct eavesdropping by third parties, but thesender still trusts the recipient to not forward or otherwise divulge thecontents of that email, directly or indirectly to any undesired third parties.As another example, in our strongest consensus protocols harmful behavior bycertain fractions of participants or intermediaries well short of 100% (asmeasured by their computing power, stake-holding, or individuation andcounting) can compromise the integrity of transactions or information flowsbetween participants and thereby on balance harm the participants.  The historically recent breakthroughs ofcomputer science can reduce vulnerabilities, often dramatically so, but theyare far from eliminating all kinds of vulnerabilities to the harmful behaviorof any potential attacker.Matchmaking is facilitating themutual discovery of mutually beneficial participants. Matchmaking is probablythe kind of social scalability at which the Internet has most excelled. Socialnetworks like Usenet News, Facebook, and Twitter facilitate the mutualdiscovery of like-minded or otherwise mutually entertaining or mutuallyinforming people (and even future spouses!). After they have allowed peoplemore likely to be of mutual benefit to discover each other, social networksthen facilitate relationships at various levels of personal investment, fromcasual to frequent to obsessive. Christopher Allen among others has done some interesting and detailed analyses about group sizeand time spent mutually interacting in online games and associated socialnetworks.eBay, Uber, AirBnB, and online financial exchanges havebrought social scalability via often great improvements in commercial matchmaking:searching for, finding, bringing together, and facilitating the negotiation ofmutually beneficial commercial or retail deals. These or related services also facilitate performances such as paymentand shipping, as well as verification that other obligations undertaken bystrangers in these deals have been performed and communication about thequality of such performances (as with “star rating” systems, Yelp reviews, andthe like).Whereas the main social scalability benefit of the Internethas been matchmaking, the predominant direct social scalability benefit ofblockchains is trust minimization. A blockchain can reduce vulnerability by lockingin the integrity of some important performances (such as the creation andpayment of money) and some important information flows, and in the future mayreduce the vulnerability of the integrity of some important matchmakingfunctions.  Trust in the secret andarbitrarily mutable activities of a private computation can be replaced byverifiable confidence in the behavior of a generally immutable publiccomputation. This essay will focus on such vulnerability reduction and itsbenefit in facilitating a standard performance beneficial to a wide variety ofpotential counterparties, namely trust-minimized money. Money and Markets Money and markets directly benefit the participants in eachparticular trade by the market matching a buyer with a mutually beneficialseller and by a widely acceptable and standardized counter-performance (money).  I use markets here in the sense Adam Smithused the term: not as a specific place or service where buyers and sellers arebrought together (although it might sometimes involve these), but rather thebroad set of typically pairwise exchanges whereby the supply chain that makes aproduct is coordinated.Money and markets also incentivize creation of more accurateprice signals that reduce negotiation costs and errors for participants inother similar exchanges.  The potent combinationof money and market thereby allowed a far higher number and variety ofparticipants to coordinate their economic activities than previous exchangeinstitutions, which more resembled bilateral monopolies than competitive markets.Markets and money involve matchmaking (bringing togetherbuyer and seller), trust reduction (trusting in the self-interest rather thanin the altruism of acquaintances and strangers), scalable performance (viamoney, a widely acceptable and reusable medium for counter-performance), andquality information flow (market prices).The greatest early thinker about money and markets was AdamSmith.  At the dawn of the industrial revolution inBritain, Smith observed in The Wealth of Nations how making even the most humble of products depended,directly and indirectly, on the work of large numbers of a wide variety ofpeople:<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Calibri;panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-520092929 1073786111 9 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;}Observethe accommodation of the most common artificer or day-laborer in a civilizedand thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of people of whoseindustry a part, though but a small part, has been employed in procuring himthis accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woolen coat, for example,which covers the day laborer, as coarse and rough as it may appear, is theproduce of the joint labor of a great multitude of workmen. The shepherd, thesorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, thespinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all jointheir different arts in order to complete even this homely production. How manymerchants and carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting thematerials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very distantpart of the country! How much commerce and navigation in particular, how manyshipbuilders, sailors, sail makers, rope makers, must have been employed inorder to bring together the different drugs made use of by the dyer, whichoften come from the remotest corners of the world! What a variety of labor,too, is necessary in order to produce the tools of the meanest of thoseworkmen! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the ship of the sailor,the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let us consider onlywhat a variety of labor is requisite in order to form that very simple machine,the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder ofthe furnace for smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of thecharcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house, the brick maker, the brick layer,the workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the forger, the smith, mustall of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were we toexamine, in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress and householdfurniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears nest his skin, the shoes whichcover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all the different parts whichcompose it, the kitchen grate at which be prepares his victuals, the coalswhich he makes use of for that purpose, dug from the bowels of the earth, andbrought to him perhaps by a long sea and a long land carriage, all the otherutensils of his kitchen, all the furniture of his table, the knives and forks,the earthen or pewter plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals,the different hands employed in preparing his bread and his beer, the glasswindow which lets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the wind and therain, with all the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that beautiful andhappy invention, without which these northern parts of the world could scarcehave afforded a very comfortable habitation, together with the tools of all thedifferent workmen employed in producing those different conveniences; if weexamine, I say, all these things, and consider what a variety of labor is employed about each of them, weshall be sensible that without the assistance and co-operation of manythousands, the very meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided,even according to what we may falsely imagine the easy and simple manner inwhich he is commonly accommodated. And this was before the many successive waves of industrialrevolution and globalization between 1776 and now that refined, elaborated, andextended the division of labor many times more. Rather than trusting in the unlikelyaltruism of so many strangers, markets and money create many pairings of mutualbenefit and thus motivate this large network of mutually oblivious people toact in our interests: In civilized society man stands at all timesin need of the cooperation and assistance of great multitudes, while his wholelife is scarce sufficient to gain the friendship of a few persons…[In contrastto other animals, man has an almost constant occasion for the help of hisbrethren, and it is vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only.  [Exchange is the] manner in which we obtainfrom another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in needof. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker,that we expect our dinner, but from their regard for their own interest. <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;}Smith goes on to describe how division of labor, and thuslabor productivity, depends on the extent of the network of pairwise exchanges:“As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labor,so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of thatpower, or, in other words, by the extent of the market”.  As the exchange network around a country andaround the globe grows, involving a greater number and variety of producers, sogrows the division of labor and thereby labor productivity.Moneyfacilitates social scalability by increasing the opportunities for thisexchange. By lowering coincidence problems (coincidence-of-wants in exchangeand coincidence-of-want-and-event in unilateral transfers), via a widelyacceptable and reusable form of wealth storage and transfer, money greatlylowered transaction costs, making possible more exchanges of a greater varietyof goods and services involving exchanges and other wealth transferrelationships with a much larger number and much wider variety of people.A wide variety of media, from oral language itself, clay,paper, telegraph, radio, and computer networks, have served to communicateoffers, acceptances, and the resulting deals and prices, as well as performancemonitoring and other business communications. One of the mostknowledgeable observations of the price network produced by markets and money canbe found in Friedrich Hayek’s essay, “The Use of Knowledge in Society”:  In a system in which the knowledge of the relevant factsis dispersed among many people, prices can act to coordinate the separateactions of different people…in any society in which many people collaborate,this planning, whoever does it, will in some measure have to be based onknowledge which, in the first instance, is not given to the planner but tosomebody else, which somehow will have to be conveyed to the planner. Thevarious ways in which the knowledge on which people base their plans iscommunicated to them is the crucial problem for any theory explaining theeconomic process, and the problem of what is the best way of utilizingknowledge initially dispersed among all the people is at least one of the mainproblems of economic policy—or of designing an efficient economic system…The mere fact that there is one price for any commodity—orrather that local prices are connected in a manner determined by the cost oftransport, etc.—brings about the solution which (it is just conceptuallypossible) might have been arrived at by one single mind possessing all theinformation which is in fact dispersed among all the people involved in theprocess…The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one rawmaterial, without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful ofpeople knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could notbe ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or itsproducts more sparingly; i.e., theymove in the right direction….The price system is just one of those formationswhich man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learnedto make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understandingit. Through it not only a division of labor but also a coordinated utilizationof resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible…asolution is produced by the interactions of people each of whom possesses onlypartial knowledge.The Social Scalability of Network Security Where long ago we used clay, and more recently paper, todayprograms and protocols running on our computers and data networks implementmost of our commercial dealings. While this has greatly improved matchmakingand information flow, it has come at the cost of an increase in vulnerabilityto harmful behavior. As networks grow, more people withfewer mutually understood habits of and constraints on behavior are added.  Security via root-trusting access control,designed for small and chummy offices like Bell Labs where co-workers were wellknown and income and expenditures well controlled by paper procedures ratherthan performed on these office computers, breaks down as an efficient andeffective security mechanism as organizations become larger, as organizationalboundaries are crossed, and as more valuable and concentrated resources such asmoney are put on or activated via the computers. The more strangers onereceives emails from, the more likely one is likely to get a phishing attack ora malware-laced attachment.  Traditionalcomputer security is not very socially scalable.

Practically all ofthese machines have architectures that were designed to be controlled by asingle person or a hierarchy of people who know and trust each other. From thepoint of view of a remote web or app user, these architectures are based onfull trust in an unknown "root" administrator, who can controleverything that happens on the server: they can read, alter, delete, or blockany data on that computer at will.  Even data sent encrypted over anetwork is eventually unencrypted and ends up on a computer controlled in thistotal way. With current web services we are fully trusting, in other words weare fully vulnerable to, the computer, or more specifically the people who haveaccess to that computer, both insiders and hackers, to faithfully execute ourorders, secure our payments, and so on.

Scalablemoney requires scalable security, so that a greater number and variety ofpeople can use the currency without losing its integrity against forgery,inflation, and theft.An individual or group communicating under the name “SatoshiNakamoto” brought Bitcoin to the Internet in 2009. Satoshi’s breakthroughwith money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerabilityto counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationallyexpensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionallyexpensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in socialscalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fullytrusted intermediary.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;}Financialcontrols on computational steroids: a blockchain as an army of robots, each checkingup on each other’s work. <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Georgia;panose-1:2 4 5 2 5 4 5 2 3 3;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;}When we can secure the most importantfunctionality of a financial network by computer science rather than by the traditionalaccountants, regulators, investigators, police, and lawyers, we go from asystem that is manual, local, and of inconsistent security to one that isautomated, global, and much more secure.

Gox; it is not going to become a trustworthy financialintermediary without that bureaucracy.Computers and networks are cheap.  Scaling computational resources requirescheap additional resources. Scaling human traditional institutions in areliable and secure manner requires increasing amounts accountants, lawyers,regulators, and police, along with the increase in bureaucracy, risk, andstress that such institutions entail. Lawyers are costly. Regulation is to themoon. Computer science secures money far better than accountants, police, andlawyers.In computerscience there are fundamental security versus performance tradeoffs. Bitcoin's automatedintegrity comes at high costs in its performance and resource usage. Nobody hasdiscovered any way to greatly increase the computational scalability of theBitcoin blockchain, for example its transaction throughput, and demonstratedthat this improvement does not compromise Bitcoin’s security.It is probable that no such big but integrity-preserving performance improvement ispossible for the Bitcoin blockchain; this may be one of these unavoidabletradeoffs.  Compared to existing financial IT, Satoshi made radicaltradeoffs in favor of security and against performance. The seemingly wastefulprocess of mining is the most obvious of these tradeoffs, but Bitcoin alsomakes others.  Among them is that it requires high redundancy in itsmessaging.  Mathematically provable integrity would require full broadcastbetween all nodes.  Bitcoin can’t achieve that but to even get anywhereclose to a good approximation of it requires a very high level of redundancy. So a 1 MB block consumes far more resources than a 1 MB web page, becauseit has to be transmitted, processed, and stored with high redundancy forBitcoin to achieve its automated integrity.Thesenecessary tradeoffs, sacrificing performance in order to achieve the securitynecessary for independent, seamlessly global, and automated integrity, meanthat the Bitcoin blockchain itself cannot possibly come anywhere near Visatransaction-per-second numbers and maintain the automated integrity thatcreates its distinctive advantages versus these traditional financial systems.Instead, a less trust-minimized peripheral payment network (possibly Lightning )will be needed to bear a larger number of lower-value bitcoin-denominatedtransactions than Bitcoin blockchain is capable of, using the Bitcoinblockchain to periodically settle with one high-value transaction batches of peripheral network transactions.Bitcoin supports a lower ratetransactions than Visa or PayPal, but due to its stronger automated securitythese can be much more important transactions. Anybodywith a decent Internet connection and a smart phone who can pay $0.20-$2transaction fees – substantially lower than current remitance fees -- canaccess Bitcoin any where on the globe. Lower value transactions with lower fees will need to be implemented onperipheral bitcoin networks.When it comesto small-b bitcoin, the currency, there is nothing impossible about payingretail with bitcoin the way you’d pay with a fiat currency —bitcoin-denominated credit and debt cards, for example, with all the chargeback and transactions-per-secondcapabilities of a credit or debit card. And there are also clever ways to doperipheral bitcoin retail payments in which small value payments happenoff-chain and are only periodically bulk-settled on the Capital-B Bitcoinblockchain. That blockchain is going to evolve into a high-value settlementlayer as bitcoin use grows, and we will see peripheral networks being used forsmall-b bitcoin retail transactions.When I designed bit gold I already knew consensus did not scale to large transaction throughputs securely,so I designed it with a two-tier architecture: (1) bit gold itself, thesettlement layer, and (2) Chaumian digital cash,a peripheral payment network which would provide retail payments with hightransactions-per-second performance and privacy (through Chaumian blinding),but would like Visa be a trusted third party and thus require a “humanblockchain” of accountants, etc. to operate with integrity.  Theperipheral payment network can involve only small value transactions, thereby requiringmuch less of a human army to avoid the fate of Mt. Gox.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;}Ralph Merkle: pioneerof public-key cryptography and inventor of hierarchical hash-tree structures(Merkle trees).<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;} Money requiressocial scalability in its design, via security.

(Source)Becauseof this fraction, and because of the (hopefully very rare) need to updatesoftware in a manner that renders prior blocks invalid – an even riskiersituation called a hard fork -- blockchains also need a human governance layerthat is vulnerable to fork politics. The most successful blockchain, Bitcoin,has maintained its immutable integrity via decentralized decision-making amongexperts in the technology combined with a strong dogma of immutability, underwhich only the most important and rare bug fixes and design improvements, thatcannot be made any other way, justify a hard fork. Under this philosophy ofgovernance accounting or legal decisions (such as altering an account balanceor undoing a transaction) never justify a hard fork, but should be accomplishedby traditional governance outside of (or on top of) the system (e.g. via acourt injunction forcing a Bitcoin user to send a new transaction thateffectively undoes the old one, or confiscating the particular keys and thusthe particular holdings of a particular user).To say thatdata is post-unforgeable or immutable means that it can’t be undetectably alteredafter being committed to the blockchain. Contrary to some hype thisdoesn’t guarantee anything about a datum’s provenance, or its truth or falsity,before it was committed to the blockchain. That requires additional protocols,often including expensive traditional controls. Blockchains don’t guaranteetruth; they just preserve truth and lies from later alteration, allowing one tolater securely analyze them, and thus be more confident in uncovering the lies.Typical computers are computational etch-a-sketch, while blockchains arecomputational amber.

It did not have the more efficient and computationally scalable blocks-and-ledger system that Bitcoin does. Also like today’s private blockchains, secure propertytitles assumed and required securely distinguishable and countable nodes.Given theobjective 51% hashrate attack limit to some important security goals of publicblockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, we actually do care about thedistinguishable identity of the most powerful miners to answer the question“can somebody convince and coordinate the 51%?Blockchainsecurity is objectively limited and blockchain governance is heavily influencedby the potential for a 51% attack.  Anattack of course does not have to be called an “attack” by the attackers;instead they might call it “enlightened governance” or “democracy inaction”.  Indeed some kinds of softwareupdates needed to fix bugs or otherwise improve the protocol require a soft fork.Some other kinds of software updates require hard forks, which in Bitcoin posean even greater security and continuity risks than soft forks. Blockchains,although reducing trust far more than any other network protocols, are stillfar from trustless. Miners are partially trusted fiduciaries, and those who arenot expert developers or computer scientists who have invested a great deal oftime in learning the design principles and codebase of a blockchain must place agreat deal of faith in the expert developer community, much as non-specialistswho want to understand the results of a specialized science do of thecorresponding scientists. During a hard fork exchanges can also be veryinfluential by deciding which fork to support with their order books and tradesymbol continuity.Publicblockchains thus mostly but not entirely dodge the identity-is-hard bullet andtake care of its remaining problem of identifying the most powerful miners at ahigher “wet”/“social” level, where it is probably more appropriate, rather thantrying to securely map such an inherently wet (brain-based) concept onto theprotocol, as PKI (public key infrastructure) rather awkwardly triesto do.So I thinksome of the “private blockchains” qualify as bona fide blockchains; othersshould go under the broader rubric of “distributed ledger” or “shared database”or similar.  They are all very different from and not nearly as sociallyscalable as public and permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.All of thefollowing are very similar in requiring an securely identified (distinguishableand countable) group of servers rather than the arbitrary anonymous membershipof miners in public blockchains. In other words, they require some other,usually far less socially scalable, solution to the Sybil (sockpuppet) attack problem:Private blockchainsThe “federated” model of sidechains (Alas, nobody has figured out how to do sidechains with anylesser degree of required trust, despite previous hopes or claims).  Sidechainscan also be private chains, and it’s a nice fit because their architectures andexternal dependencies (e.g. on a PKI) are similar.Multisig-basedschemes, even when done with blockchain-based smart contractsThreshold-based “oracle” architectures for moving off-blockchain data onto blockchainsThe dominant,but usually not very socially scalable, way to identify a group of servers iswith a PKI based on trusted certificate authorities (CAs).To avoid the problem that merely trusted third parties are security holes, reliable CAs themselves must be expensive, labor-intensivebureaucracies that often do extensive background checks themselves or rely onothers (e.g. Dun and Bradstreet for businesses) to do so.  (I once led ateam that designed and built such a CA).  CAs also act as a gatekeeper,rendering these permissioned systems. CAs can become singular points ofpolitical control and failure.  "Public blockchains are automated,secure, and global, but identity is labor-intensive, insecure, and local.” PKI-enabledprivate blockchains are a nice for banks and some other large enterprisesbecause they already have mature in-house PKIs that cover the employees,partners, and private servers needed to approve important transactions. Bank PKIs are relatively reliable. We also have semi-reliable CAs for webservers, but not generally speaking for web clients, even though people havebeen working on the problem of client certificates since the invention of theweb: for example advertisers would love to have a more secure alternative tophone numbers and cookies for tracking customer identities. Yet it hasn’thappened.  PKI can workwell for some important things and people but it is not nearly so nice or soeasy for lesser entities. Its social scalability is limited by the traditionalwet identity bureaucracy on which it depends.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face{font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-font-charset:78;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face{font-family:"Cambria Math";panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;}@font-face{font-family:Georgia;panose-1:2 4 5 2 5 4 5 2 3 3;mso-font-charset:0;mso-generic-font-family:auto;mso-font-pitch:variable;mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal{mso-style-unhide:no;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault{mso-style-type:export-only;mso-default-props:yes;font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1{size:8.5in 11.0in;margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 85.5pt;mso-header-margin:.5in;mso-footer-margin:.5in;mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1{page:WordSection1;}Some significant thefts in the broader bitcoin ecosystem. Whereas the Bitcoin blockchainitself is probably the most secure financial network in existence (and indeed must remain far more secure than traditional payment networks in order to maintain its low governance costs and seamless cross-border capability), itsperipheral services based on older centralized web servers are very insecure. (Source: author)We need moresocially scalable ways to securely count nodes, or to put it another way towith as much robustness against corruption as possible, assess contributions tosecuring the integrity of a blockchain. That is what proof-of-work and broadcast-replicationare about: greatly sacrificing computational scalability in order to improvesocial scalability.  That is Satoshi’s brilliant tradeoff.   Itis brilliant because humans are far more expensive than computers and that gapwidens further each year.  And it is brilliant because it allows one toseamlessly and securely work across human trust boundaries (e.g. nationalborders), in contrast to “call-the-cop” architectures like PayPal and Visa thatcontinually depend on expensive, error-prone, and sometimes corruptiblebureaucracies to function with a reasonable amount of integrity.Conclusion  The rise of the Internet as seen the rise of a variety ofonline institutions, among them social networks, “long-tail” retail (e.g.Amazon), and a variety of services that allow small and dispersed buyers andsellers to find and do business with each other (eBay, Uber, AirBnB, etc.)  These are just the initial attempts to takeadvantage of our new abilities.  Due tothe massive improvements in information technology over recent decades, thenumber and variety of people who can successfully participate in an onlineinstitution is far less often restricted by the objective limits of computersand networks than it is by limitations of mind and institution that have usuallyhave not yet been sufficiently redesigned or further evolved to take advantageof those technological improvements.These initial Internet efforts have been very centralized.  Blockchain technology, which implements data integrity via computer science rather than via “call the cops”, has so far made possible trust-minimized money -- cryptocurrencies – and will let us make progress in other financial areas as well as other areas where transactions can be based primarily on data available online.This is not to say that adapting our institutions to our new capabilities will be easy, or indeed in particular cases anything short of difficult and improbable.  Utopian schemes are very popular in the blockchain community, but they are not viable options. Reverse-engineering our highly evolved traditional institutions, and even reviving in new form some old ones, will usually work better than designing from scratch, than grand planning and game theory. One important strategy for doing so was demonstrated by Satoshi – sacrifice computational efficiency and scalability  -- consume more cheap computational resources -- in order to reduce and better leverage the great expense in human resources needed to maintain the relationships between strangers involved modern institutions such as markets, large firms, and governments.
Broadcasts using sound or radiation, from sources such as radio, bell towers, and astronomical phenomena, must send out the same value to every receiver. A remote beacon such as a pulsar has perfect security: the access structure is any party, and its complement, the attack structure, is the empty set. For human controlled broadcasts, the attack structure consists only of the broadcaster and the access structure is any receiver.Natural broadcasts are thus immune to the problem (known in computer science as the Byzantine Generals problem) of a transmitter sending different values to different receivers. Indeed, distributed network researchers have gone to great lengths to recreate this simple property on the Internet with logical broadcast protocols.  The results are incomplete and very inefficient compared to physical broadcasts.Nature provides clocks that are oblivious to the malicious intentions of any outside parties and many orders of magnitude more accurate than random delays that face attackers on the Internet. If critical Internet servers were synchronized to natural clocks in a secure and timely fashion, they would be immune to attacks that relied on uncertainties in timing. Here are some comparisons of the stability (error creep) in good natural clocks.

There are may examples of coercive political power both today and in history that don't fit in to the academic idea of "the state" as a "monopoly of force."  Federalism, separation of powers, and many examples of legally "taking the law into one's own hands" are just three categories of examples.   Here, we look at another, mostly forgotten but once ubiquitous category from history: political power wielded by private individuals or commercial organizations, with profits or the equivalent as a primary incentive of the organization.These were entities quite different from both modern governments and modern economic corporations.   These wielders of coercive power for profit combined the efficiency of private enterprise with the often ruthless coercion of government.  In the Roman Republic there were a number of corporations that were granted various kinds of political power.   The most notorious were the publicani, the ruthlessly efficient tax farmers.  Tax farmers were private contractors to governments or other coercively funded entities (such as colonial corporations, examples of which we will see below).  Through history tax farmers have been famed and reviled for their efficient operations and ruthless treatment of taxpayers.   The publicani, for example, deployed crucifixion and other forms of torture to extract financial information from their victims.  Tax farmers were, however, at least more honest than modern tax collectors.  Tax farmers knew who their customers were -- governments or other coercively funded organizations.  Like any other collection agency their customers were the creditors, not the debtors.  They never propounded the pathetic mythology of some modern government tax collectors that their quite involuntary debtors, rather than their respective governments, are their "customers".It is not well understood by Romanist moderns that monarchy was based, not primarily on Burkean romantic worship or the divine right of kings, but rather on the political property rights of an individual and his heirs.   The laws of inheritance for a monarch were usually the same as those for land.   Furthermore, at most places and times the monarch did not have a monopoly of political power, but rather by prescription or grant many other entities -- nobles, burghers, and corporations chief among these -- also held political property rights.  Modern "titles" are the shell of a system that once involved extensive political property rights.  As I described in my paper "Jurisdiction as Property", the most basic aspects of the medieval and Renaissance English legal system -- from which much of the modern writs, common law, and constitutions of England, Commonwealth and United States legal systems are derived -- were the laws that defined the rights and trespasses involving political property.  After a long lapse from the records of history, the Roman corporate form reanimated in the form both of independent cities -- municipal corporations that gave rise to republics -- and in forms like the Genovese maone and similar organizations in other late medieval Italian republics.   The maone issued securities that acted much like stock shares, effectively paying dividends, although technically they were treated as debt instruments rather than ownership shares.   They engaged in colonial conquests and administration, tax farming, or other subsets of governmental functions.  A fuller account of the maone and their role in originating the modern corporation can be found here.Sir Francis Drake, commander of joint-stock navies.There is also a long history of armed forces for profit -- of mercenaries, private escorts, privateering, and sheer piracy.   The main colonial companies, such as the East and West India companies of Britain, the Netherlands, and other colonial powers, deployed their own naval forces to protect their own fleets and on occasion to attack rival shipping.  Among the first English joint-stock corporations were the temporary joint-stock companies set up by Drake and Hawkins to trade with the Spanish colonies (from the Spanish point of view to smuggle) and raid the Spanish gold and silver fleets.  Despite their profit motive, which put a premium on trading and raiding rather than defense, these private navies also successfully defended England.  The battle of against the Spanish Armada was won, not by the Royal Navy (which did not yet exist), but by the joint-stock naval corporations of Drake and Hawkins.  Drake's circumnavigation of the globe in 1577-80 was also funded by a joint-stock company created for the purpose.  The profits came from trading/smuggling and privateering against the Spanish Main.Most of the British colonies overseas (and many of those of Brtitain's rivals) were organized as corporations for profit, and most of these at one point or another issued stock. The political consequences of such corporate colonies were highly controversial and highly varied. In America, the corporate charters guarunteed "the rights of Englishmen"; that and a large frontier (and thus low exit costs) produced a very libertarian political system.   Some American charters, such as the Massachusetts Bay Company, guarunteed that all freeholders of land within the corporation's land grant could vote on the corporate by-laws, which effectively became the laws of the land.   This set the stage for two of the most distinctive characteristics of the later United States -- both its democracy (in contrast to their status in England, most early English settlers in America were landowners ("freeman") and thus entitled by charter to vote) and its written constitutions enforced by judicial review (because the charter -- in modern corporate parlance the articles of incorporation -- trumps mere legislation -- in modern corporate parlance the by-laws).Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company, 1628In Africa, by sharp contrast, the main business was slaving, and the charters of the African corporations authorized them to wield martial law, which they did with ruthlessnes.   The most infamous of these African companies operated, however, after the era of individual slavery had ended.   Instead of overt slavery the Congo Free State instituted a system effectively worse than slavery -- a tax system based on in-kind payments of rubber.  The barbarous cruelty of the resulting system was immortalized in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.   In between these political extremes, the East India Companies and many other colonial companies operated across the globe, at first assisting local entities in military, tax collecton, and administration, but eventually taking over these governmental functions and reaping often immense profits as a result.  They brought literacy and very efficient and modern administration but also often engaged in an exploitation that was widely percieved as so ruthless that the East India Company became profoundly unpopular and was eventually nationalized.Administration by the colonial companies was usually far more efficient, for example in terms of European manpower deployed, than the later administration by the governments of European powers when these companies were nationalized in the 19th and 20th centuries.  By the end of the 18th century these companies had become highly unpopular in government circles.  The rise of democracy and the Romanist ideology of the monolithic state spelled their doom.   Ideologists and scholars as varied as Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, and Karl Marx railed against the depradations of the colonial corporations.   For Marx these epitomized the evil of capitalism generally, whereas Smith and Burke were careful to distinguish the wielding of coercive political power, which they found particularly destructive in this form, from the wielding of voluntary economic power, which they found highly beneficial.Besides the links above, here are some further references:E.

Theoretical or futuristic technologies have long been a staple of science fiction. Increasingly the future of technology development has become an important political issue as decisions are made to fund a variety of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies in response to projected long-term climate changes, medical technologies to address health problems and epidemic threats, military R&D in response to recent and feared future security threats, and so on. Hundreds of billions of dollars of R&D funding over the next decade hinges on questions of future technologies.  Some of these technologies in some of their forms may be harmful or dangerous; can we evaluate these dangers before spending billions of dollars of development and capital investment in technologies that may end up expensively restricted or banned as designed?We lack a good discipline of theoretical technology.  As a result, discussion of such technologies among scientists and engineers and laypeople alike often never gets beyond naive speculation, which ranges from dismissing or being antagonistic to such possibilities altogether to proclamations that sketchy designs in hard-to-predict areas of technology are easy and/or inevitable and thus worthy of massive attention and R&D funding. At one extreme are recent news stories, supposedly based on the new IPCC report on global warming, that claim that we will not be able to undo the effects of global warming for at least a thousand years. At the other extreme are people like Eric Drexler and Ray Kurzweil who predict runaway technological progress within our lifetimes, allowing us to not only easily and quickly reverse global warming but also conquer death, colonize space, and much else. Such astronomically divergent views, each held by highly intelligent and widely esteemed scientists and engineers, reflect vast disagreements about the capabilities of future technology. Today we lack good ways for proponents of such views to communicate in a disciplined way with each other or to the rest of us about such claims and we lack good ways as individuals, organizations, and as a society to evaluate them.Sometimes descriptions of theoretical technologies lead to popular futuristic movements such as extropianism, transhumanism, cryonics, and many others. These movements make claims, often outlandish but not refuted by scientific laws, that the nature of technologies in the future should influence how we behave today. In some cases this leads to quite dramatic changes in outlook and behavior. For example, people ranging from baseball legend Ted Williams to cryptography pioneer and nanotechnologist Ralph Merkle have spent up to a hundred thousand dollars or more to have their bodies frozen in the hopes that future technologies will be able to fix the freezing damage and cure whatever killed them. Such beliefs can radically alter a person's outlook on life, but how can we rationally evaluate their credibility?Some scientific fields have developed that inherently involve theoretical technology. For example, SETI (and less obviously its cousin astrobiology) inherently involve speculation about what technologies hypothetical aliens might possess.Eric Drexler called the study of such theoretical technologies "exploratory engineering" or "theoretical applied science." Currently futurists tend to evaluate such designs based primarily on their mathematical consistency with known physical law. But mere mathematical consistency with high-level abstractions is woefully insufficient, except in computer science or where only the simplest of physics is involved, for demonstrating the future workability or desirability of possible technologies. And it falls far short of the criteria engineers and scientists generally use to evaluate each others' work.Traditional science and engineering methods are ill-equipped to deal with such proposals. As "critic" has pointed out, both demand near-term experimentation or tests to verify or falsify claims about the truth of a theory or whether a technology actually works. Until such an experiment has occurred a scientific theory is a mere hypothesis, and until a working physical model, or at least a description sufficient to create such has been produced, a proposed technology is merely theoretical. Scientists tend to ignore theories that they have no prospect of testing and engineers tend to ignore designs that have no imminent prospect of being built, and in the normal practice of these fields this is a quite healthy attitude. But to properly evaluate theoretical technologies we need ways other than near-term working models to reduce the large uncertainties in such proposals and to come to some reasonable estimates of their worthiness and relevance to R&D and other decisions we make today.The result of these divergent approaches is that when scientists and engineers talk to exploratory engineers they talk past each other. In fact, neither side has been approaching theoretical technology in a way that allows it to be properly evaluated. Here is one of the more productive such conversations -- the typical one is even worse. The theoreticians' claims are too often untestable, and the scientists and engineers too often demand inappropriately that descriptions be provided that would allow one to actually build the devices with today's technology.To think about how we might evaluate theoretical technologies, we can start by looking a highly evolved system that technologists have long used to judge the worthiness of new technological ideas -- albeit not without controversy -- the patent system.The patent system sets up several basic requirements for proving that an invention is worthy enough to become a property right: novelty, non-obviousness, utility, and enablement.   (Enablement is also often called "written description" or "sufficiency of disclosure", although sometimes these are treated as distinct requirements that we need not get into for our purposes). Novelty and non-obviousness are used to judge whether a technology would have been invented anyway and are largely irrelevant for our purposes here (which is good news because non-obviousness is the source of most of the controversy about patent law). To be worthy of discussion in the context of, for example, R&D funding decisions, the utility of a theoretical technology, if or when in the future it is made to work, should be much larger than that required for a patent -- the technology if it works should be at least indirectly of substantial expected economic importance. I don't expect meeting this requirement to be much of a problem, as futurists usually don't waste much time on the economically trivial, and it may only be needed to distinguish important theoretical technologies from those merely found in science fiction for the purposes of entertainment.The patent requirement that presents the biggest problem for theoretical technologies is enablement. The inventor or patent agent must write a description of the technology detailed enough to allow another engineer in the field to, given a perhaps large but not infinite amount of resources, build the invention and make it work. If the design is not mature enough to build -- if, for example, it requires further novel and non-obvious inventions to build it and make it work -- the law deems it of too little importance to entitle the proposer to a property right in it.  Implementing the description must not require so much experimentation that it becomes a research project in its own right.An interesting feature of enablement law is the distinction it makes between fields that are considered more predictable or less so.  Software and (macro-)mechanical patents generally fall under the "predictable arts" and require must less detailed description to be enabling.  But biology, chemistry, and many other "squishier" areas are much less predictable and thus require far more detailed description to be considered enabling. Theoretical technology lacks enablement. For example, no astronautical engineer today can take Freeman Dyson's description of a Dyson Sphere and go out and build one, even given a generous budget. No one has been able to take Eric Drexler's Nanosystems and go out and build a molecular assembler. From the point of view of the patent system and of typical engineering practice, these proposals either require far more investment than is practical, or far have too many engineering uncertainties and dependencies on other unavailable technology to build them, or both, and thus are not worth considering.For almost all scientists and engineers, the lack of imminent testability or enablement puts such ideas out of their scope of attention. For the normal practice of science and engineering this is healthy, but it can have quite unfortunate consequences when decisions about what kinds of R&D to fund are made or about how to respond to long-term problems. As a society we must deal with long-term problems such as undesired climate change. To properly deal with such problems we need ways to reason about what technologies may be built to address them over the spans of decades, centuries, or even longer over which we reason about and expect to deal with such problems. For example, the recent IPCC report on global warming has projected trends centuries in the future, but has not dealt in any serious or knowledgeable way with how future technologies might either exacerbate or ameliorate such trends over such a long span of time -- even though the trends they discuss are primarily caused by technologies in the first place.Can we relax the enablement requirement to create a new system for evaluating theoretical technologies? We might call the result a "non-proximately enabled invention" or a "theoretical patent." [UPDATE:  note that this is not a proposal for an actual legally enforceable long-term patent.  This is a thought experiment for the purposes of seeing to what extent patent-like criteria can be used for evaluating theoretical technology].  It retains (and even strengthens) the utility requirement of a patent, but it relaxes the enablement requirement in a disciplined way. Instead of enabling a fellow engineer to build the device, the description must be sufficient to enable an research project -- a series of experiments and tests that would if successful lead to a working invention, and if unsuccessful would serve to demonstrate that the technology as proposed probably can't be made to work.It won't always be possible to test claims about theoretical designs.  They may be of a nature as to require technological breakthroughs to even test their claims.  In many cases this will be due the lack of appreciation on the part of the theoretical designer of the requirement that such designs be testable.  In some cases it will be the lack of skill or imagination of the theoretical designer to fail to be able to come up with such tests.  In some cases it will be because the theoretical designer refuses to admit the areas of uncertainty in the design and thus denies the need for experiment to reduce these uncertainties.  In some cases it may just be inherent in the radically advanced nature of the technology being studied that there is no possible way to test it without making other technology advances.  Regardless of the reason the designs are untestable, these designs cannot be considered to be anything but entertaining science fiction.  In only the most certain of areas -- mostly just in computer science and in the simplest and most verified of physics -- should mathematically valid but untested claims be deemed credible for the purposes of making important decisions.  Both successful and unsuccessful experiments that reduce uncertainty are valuable. Demonstrating that the technology can work as proposed allows lower-risk investments in it to be made sooner, and leads to decisions better informed about the capabilities of future technology. Demonstrating that it can't work as proposed prevents a large amount of money from being wasted trying to build it and prevents decisions from being made today based on the assumption that it will work in the future.The distinction made by patent systems between fields that are more versus less predictable becomes even more important for theoretical designs. In computer science the gold standard is mathematical proof rather than experiment, and given such proof no program of experiment need be specified.  Where simple physics is involved, such as the orbital mechanics used to plan space flights, the uncertainty is also usually very small and proof based on known physical laws is generally sufficient to show the future feasibility of orbital trajectories.  (Whether the engines can be built to achieve such trajectories is another matter).  Where simple scaling processes are involved (e.g. scaling up rockets from Redstone sized to Saturn sized) uncertainties are relatively small.  Thus, to take our space flight example, the Apollo program had a relatively low uncertainty well ahead of time, but it was unusual in this regard.  As soon as we get into dependency on new materials (e.g. the infamous "unobtainium" material stronger than any known materials), new chemical reactions or new ways of performing chemical reactions, and so on, things get murkier far more quickly, and it is essential to good theoretical design that these uncertainties be identified and that experiments to reduce them be designed.In other words, the designers of a theoretical technology in any but the most predictable of areas should identify its assumptions and claims that have not already been tested in a laboratory. They should design not only the technology but also a map of the uncertainties and edge cases in the design and a series of such experiments and tests that would progressively reduce these uncertainties. A proposal that lacks this admission of uncertainties coupled with designs of experiments that will reduce such uncertainties should not be deemed credible for the purposes of any important decision. We might call this requirement a requirement for a falsifiable design.Falsifiable design resembles the systems engineering done with large novel technology programs, especially those that require large amounts of investment. Before making the large investments tests are conducted so that the program, if it won't actually work, will "fail early" with minimal loss, or will proceed with components and interfaces that actually work. Theoretical design must work on the same principle, but on longer time scales and with even greater uncertainty. The greater uncertainties involved make it even more imperative that uncertainties be resolved by experiment.The distinction between a complete blueprint or enabling description and a description for the purposes of enabling falsifiability of a theoretical design is crucial. A patent enablement or an architectural blueprint is an a description of how to build. An enablement of falsifiability is a description of if it were built -- and we don't claim to be describing or even to know how to build it -- there is how we believe it would function, here are the main uncertainties on how it would function, and here are the experiments that can be done to reduce these uncertainties.Good theoretical designers should be able to recognize the uncertainties in their own and others' designs. They should be able to characterize the uncertainties in such a way as to that evaluators to assign probabilities to the uncertainties and to decide what experiments or tests can most easily reduce the uncertainties. It is the recognition of uncertainties and the plan of uncertainty reduction, even more than the mathematics demonstrating the consistency of the design with physical law, that will enable the theoretical technology for the purposes, not of building it today, but of making important decisions today based on to what degree we can reasonably expect it to be built and produce value in the future.Science fiction is an art form in which the goal is to suspend the reader's disbelief by artfully avoiding mention of the many uncertainties involved in the wonderful technologies. To be useful and credible -- to achieve truth rather than just the comfort or entertainment of suspension of disbelief -- theoretical design must do the opposite -- it must highlight the uncertainties and emphasize near-term experiments that can be done to reduce them.
Historical novelist Robert Harris writes a good article on the parallels between Pompey's war on piracy, accompanied by the Lex Gabina, and the modern war on terror and accompanying expansion of unchecked executive power. The ancient Greek historian Plutarch wrote that the Lex Gabina, a response to piratical terrorism at Rome's main port, Ostia, ceded "what amounted in fact to an absolute authority and uncontrolled power over everyone." Literally Pompey was granted an authority to wage war that extended fifty miles inland from any coast, which included Rome and most other major cities and towns of the Republic. Perhaps not far from the arbitrary detentions now allowed under the new Military Commissions Act. The MCA grants the U.S. military the authority to detain either U.S. citizens or foreigners anywhere in the world and try them before military commissions with a bare minimum of due process. If you are not a U.S. citizen, there is no appeal to normal U.S. courts as habeas corpus for you has been suspended, regardless of whether you reside in the U.S.Pompey did far better than our modern terror warriors: he is reported to have eliminated the pirate threat all across the Mediterranean within three months. But this was not followed by a rescinding of his powers. Rather, military jurisdiction over civilians came to be seen as normal, and political opposition to these powers came to be seen as a form of aid and comfort to rebels or pirates, and thus legally categorized alongside rebellion and piracy. Julius Caesar, followed by Augustus Caesar, would soon usurp Pompey's power, ending the Republic and creating the totalitarian Empire. (Yes, the political plot of "Star Wars" was loosely based on these all too real events).Another parallel closer to our time was the Reichstag Fire, a terrorist attack which was followed by the Enabling Act. This statute, however, was a far more overt assumptions of arbitrary executive power and abrogation of the constitution than the Military Commissions Act.The conversion of democratic fear into totalitarian power is a very ancient and devasting pattern.
The modern joint-stock corporation has many sources in medieval Europe. First among these was corporate law itself. Although the era is commonly referred to as "feudalism," for the hierarchy of individually owned "fiefs" of land and control of serfs as fixtures of that land, large amounts of wealth in Europe were actually controlled by corporate entities. Chief among these were church lands, the corporate entities being dioceses, religious orders and the Roman Church itself. These entities controlled a substantial fraction of the land in Western Europe. Furthermore cities (with varying degrees of political independence), merchant guilds, craft guilds, and many charitable entities (such as hospitals) were legal "corporations," i.e. artificial and perpetual legal persons under law. Some basic issues in corporate law (for example, when are officers individually liable for acts of the corporation, and when the corporation is liable for acts of its agents) had already been solved in canon law and urban law long before the joint-stock corporation.Another source of the joint-stock corporation was the tradition of dividing ownership over tangible things into "shares." For example, it was common in Italian maritime states fund the construction and operation of ships by dividing them into a certain number of shares (24 and 64 were common divisions). Share owners were responsible for funding voyages (not including cargo, which was typically paid for by trading partnerships called commenda) as well as the initial construction capital, and divided up the profits (fees paid by the merchants less costs). This tradition faded away in Venice when that republic's government took over ship ownership, but thrived across the Italian penninsula in Genoa. Ship shares became embedded into maritime law all over Europe and even survived the British Empire (today in Canada when you register a boat the government still registers 64 shares in it for its owner). The only organization controlled by the shareholders, however, was the captain and crew of the ship.The medieval organizations that most resembled later joint-stock corporations were the Genovese maone. These bore some strong resemblances to the publicani tax farming corporations of the Roman Republican era, although it is not clear how they could have survived the intervening Late Empire and Dark Ages other than as very obscure (and perhaps now lost) written descriptions. In form and function maone also bore strong resemblances to some early joint-stock companies such as the Bank of Amsterdam, Bank of England, and the Dutch and English East India Companies.The Italian cities often sold off their tax receivables to wealthy merchants at a discount as a way to borrow funds. (Discounting was one of the many ways late medieval financiers avoided the rather lax and narrow usury restrictions). The debts were divided into equal shares called loca or partes. Legally, these shares were personal property (chattels) and could be freely traded.Technically, no organization was created when the city sold its tax receivables to merchants. However, to effectively collect the taxes, the holders of loca formed an organization called a maona or societas comperarum. This organization would then subcontract to tax farmers to collect the taxes. By the fourteenth century, Genovese maone also engaged in military conquest and colonization. These were, quite literally, corporate raiders.Normally, maone were temporary, but some of them ended up lasting for a long time. In 1346 the Maona di Chio e di Focea (a company for managing the taxes of Chios and Focea) was formed. This organization's members obtained from Genoa the exclusive right to collect taxes from Chios (an Aegean island) and Phocaea (a port on the Anatolian coast). But first the company would have to conquer them! Although technically a temporary organization, it lasted until 1566.Rather than going to buy receivables from Genoa, subscriptions to the di Chio e di Focea's loca shares (still legally debt, but to be paid out in dividends as taxes and trading revenues were collected) went to fund 29 galleys to conquer Chios and Phocaea. The Genovese Republic, for a fee, granted the organization exclusive rights to collect taxes from the conquered territories as well as special trading privileges. The conquests, taxes, and trading were at least partially successful, and by the 16th century more than 600 persons owned loca of the maona. This function and some of this structure would later be emulated by the Dutch and English India Companies, but with a basic legal difference -- "shares" in these later joint-stock companies would constitute ownership (like ship shares) not debt as with the maona.The most famous Genovese maona was the Officium procuratorum San Giorgio, later the Banco di San Giorgio. Founded in 1407, this bank (and a later Genovese bank along the same lines, the Bank of Genoa) would be the inspiration for later central banks such as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England. Banco di San Giorgio came to administer most of the Genovese Republic's debts. Dividends were paid out of tax collections (less directly than with earlier maona, but still more directly than the later Bank of England). The maona business was becoming more monopolistic, as it had become in Venice and would become with later central banks.At the same time, however, the ship share system spread to northern Europe and branched out beyond ships. In Italy and Germany by the 16th century a wide variety of mines were divied up into ownership shares. During the Reformation, a pious follower of Martin Luther gave him some kuxen, shares in a mine in Saxony. Luther complained that he did not know what to do with them. (Indeed, since as with ship shares the mine managers could call on investors to pay up more capital, ownership was not for the financially naive).Martin LutherShip shares and mine shares like these were issued in small numbers (usually between 24 and 640) and thus were not typically traded on exchanges. The number of employees was also small, usually no more than a few dozen. Kuxen were reportedly sometimes traded at the Leipzig fairs. Indeed, illiquidity was the rule in the first century of English joint-stock companies. It was not until the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (the Dutch East India Company, founded out of a merger of smaller colonial companies in 1602) that volume existed to trade company shares on exhanges (which up to that time traded state and municipal bonds and commodities).Interestingly, the first joint-stock companies chartered by the English Crown (starting in 1553) were companies involved in trading (the Muscovy and Levant companies), mining (the Royal Mines and the Mineral and Battery), and trading combined with conquest (the India Companies, the Virginia and Plymouth companies, etc.) The two mining companies borrowed not only shares but managers and engineers (presumably along with their techniques) from Germany. The Genovese for their part would have felt at home with the trading and conquest companies.References include:Harold Berman, Law and Revolution.Guido Ferrarini, "Origins of Limited Liability Companies and Company Law Modernisation in Italy: A Historical Outline", Centro di Diritto e Finanza WP 5-2002.Meir Kohn, "The Capital Market Before 1600", working paper 99-06, February 1999.
I recently found a delightful new book, The Origins of Value: The Financial Innovations That Created Modern Capital Markets, edited by Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst.  Besides the wonderful pictures (it doubles as coffee-table book), it contains a variety of articles on the precursors and antecedents of modern trade in stocks, debt, and financial instruments.  Each article is (co-)written by different noted authorities in the history of financial markets.Just some of the highlights: tallies, chirographs, Chinese paper money (a kind of sad history paralleling the 20th century experience with government currencies), the Roman publicani, Fibonacci on present value, securitization of government debt in Venice and Genoa, the Dutch East India Company (VOC -- the first corporation whose stock was widely traded), a silly defense of John Law (making some noteworthy economic observations justifies coercing and defrauding millions?), and a perpetuity that financed a 17th-century Dutch dike and is still being paid today.The book is biased towards finding antecedents of surface phenomena of modern capital markets, and thus is narrower than a good history of economic institutions would be.  The importance of the legal idea of a corporation as a "person" is briefly noted, for example, but the many tricky legal issues this raises that must be solved before such an institution can become widely viable, the shortcomings of Roman law in this regard (despite the publicani, which are so poorly recorded in the historical record we lack many important details on their legal structure and operations) are not raised.  Nor are contributions to corporate law of the Catholic Church, municipalities, and guilds in the Middle Ages (not to mention Western law schools, which first appeared then), long before Dutch East India Company, mentioned.   Indeed, most of the important legal issues that must be solved to make modern capital markets possible are just not addressed, despite the vast documentary record of legal codes and decisions from Babylon, Rome, medieval Europe, and other places where such legal breakthroughs were made.  Some important issues of trust and security are raised or at least hinted at, but are usually not explored in detail.  The crucial role of accounting is given short shrift.  There is not a lot of economic theory and it doesn't go much beyond standard financial economics, which may not provide a very good model many of the ancient, high transaction cost eras discussed.These, however, are just grumbles about how reality always falls far short of the ideals one can envision. After all, the subtitle says "...Financial Innovations...", not accounting or legal or in general institutional innovations that made modern capital markets possible.  And I don't know of any single book out there that explores so many episodes of ancient, medieval, and renaissance financial history in such a detailed and colorful way.
I will soon be posting portions of a translation of the Magna Carta (the Great Charter) interspersed with my own commentary.  Besides the background of the above link, here is some background on the nature of law and political structure in the lands of King John in 1215, and on why the document is more relevant to the modern United States than it is to modern England.What follows is a necessarily oversimplified summary, but it can be used to reconstruct almost all of the law of King John's England pertinent to Magna Carta.  Such a summary must in some ways be very alien to modern minds, so if you question this summary in any way please read the Magna Carta itself first before commenting, as you will probably find that the alien law as I describe it is in fact reflected in that Great Charter.The basic building block of English legal and political structure was quite simple: property.  Tyler Cowen talks about modern "markets in everything."  In King John's England there was property in everything.  Often, however, it was property that could not be easily bought or sold, but only inherited or transfered in marriage (like the kingship itself).  Every political office and every legal right was such a property right.  Jurisdiction, the right to make law, as well as goods and land -- all was property.  Often these rights were appurtenant (i.e. attached to) rights in other kinds of property.  For example, the jurisdiction and right to enforce judgments of manorial courts via certain remedies (a subset of the remedies available to royal common law courts) came bundled with tenure to the  manor'sland.  For example, if the king had granted a land to a lord in fee simple (i.e. perpetual) tenure, that lord would by an appurtenant express grant or sometimes implicitly (by prescription or custom) have jurisdiction over the manor's sub-tenants and villiens (serfs).  Jursidiction over market fairs and their participants, and the ability to enforce court judgments by the limited remedy of distraining (attaching) goods in those markets, came bundled with the royal or baronial franchise to operate the market.  Even in the 18th century, Blackstone described the entire political structure of England under the legal category of "the rights of persons."  Every office and authority was held as a property right, and every liberty of a tenant or other subject was an easement that restricted such a property right.Tenures such as fee simple, estates for life, etc. are the ancestors of modern forms of ownership (which still go under these names), but are also akin to leases insofar as they entailed obligations such as to pay rent.  Rent paid to the king included "scutage" and "aid" -- the ancestor of what we now call taxes.  The Magna Carta forces the king to gain the "consent" of his immediate tenants via a vote of what became Parliament before collecting such rents.  Tenancy was also in some ways akin to modern citizenship, as the obligations of a tenant often included providing military service and submitting to the jurisdiction of the landlord where such jurisdiction was appurtenant to that lord's property.  The jurisdiction of the royal courts was appurtenant to the king's original ownership of his realm, and many lords also had jurisdictions appurtenant to their manors.Thus, the Magna Carta's language is quite akin to either a medieval or a modern property deed that grants various rights and reserves various easements appurtenant (i.e. attached to) the property in question.  Any such deed, license, or charter grants a subset of the bundle of rights belonging to the current owner to the new owner or (in the case of a lease) tenant.  The Magna Carta is such a property deed. The property in question is the entire kingdom and various subsets thereof, and the various rights and easements are appurtenant to the entire kingdom or particular subsets thereof. The rights the charter grants are to "all free men of the kingdom" or various subsets thereof.  The "kingdom" is the property of the king and his heirs from which he is granting rights to English subjects and their heirs.Except for the king, who under Norman theory owned all original rights in the realm, these rights took the form of tenures (somewhat akin to our leases) and franchises.   In theory all such rights became such by grants from the king.  In practice these "grants" often recognized pre-existing rights.   Thus they were akin to both prescriptive property rights and to natural or customary legal rights.  These tenures or franchises were often granted perpetuity; sometimes they were for a term of years.  If they were granted in perpetuity, under English law (which unlike Roman law did not recognize the totalitarian idea of sovereignty) they could not be legally taken back by future kings.  The Magna Carta, for example, grants "all the liberties written out below, to have and to keep for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs."  The listed liberties are a mix of rights granted to pacify rebellious subjects and the recognition of prescriptive rights, often of a very broad (unenumerated) nature. The totalitarian idea of sovereignty, derived from the ancient law of the Roman emperors in Justinian's Institutes, whereby emperors were the source of all law (the sovereign) and could always disobey or retract their own edicts, was much later adopted (at least the retraction part) in England as the sovereignty of Parliament.  This new "democratic" sovereignty asserted that Parliament could abrogate rights granted in perpetuity by previous royal charters.  This was the main legal idea in dispute in the American Revolution.  The colonists argued that Parliament could not abrogate the royal charters to the colonies which, like the parts of the Magna Carta which recognized the rights of cities, towns, and the Church in a sweeping way, recognized customs and liberties of the inhabitants of colonies in a sweeping way.  During and after their successful rebellion, the North American colonists adopted state constitutions, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution.  These were modeled on previous royal charters and, contrary to the recent innovation of Parliamentary sovereignty that the colonists rebelled against, could not be abrogated by mere legislation. In a democratic compromise, however, (following James Wilson's vague idea of the "sovereignty of the people"), these charters were adopted by super-majority votes of "the people" (typically conventions of representatives) and could be amended by super-majority votes (legislatures, referendums, and/or conventions).  Thus, the United States introduced democracy while maintaining the idea of perpetual rights that cannot be abrogated by mere majorities.  Thus the Magna Carta, one of the earliest charters granting perpetual rights, is even more important to the United States than it is to the democratic, yet totalitarian, modern England.
Why did the early United States have much stronger property rights and far lower taxes than today, even though it is nominally governed by the same political form and a constitution that has undergone only a few amendments?  Why do Hong Kong and Singapore currently lead the world in economic freedom? Why did the fall of the Berlin Wall spell the end of European communist states? What political changes or changes to our own lives would give us stronger property rights and lower taxes?What stands out about Singapore and Hong Kong --and other entities that have the most economic freedom in their region, such as Bahrain in the Arab Middle East -- is that they specialize in international trade. To encourage business travel, they must put few restrictions and tax penalties on travel. Large proportions of their population have strong international social ties. Large proportions of the population of these countries could easily move out of the country if their local rights were violated.  Strong international personal and business ties allow them to quickly reestablish themselves in a different, but not so foreign, country.In other words, when a small country specializes in mediation of international trade, the exit costs for the people from whom it collects most of its tax revenue is low.  To maintain their tax revenues they must maintain a productive international trade business, and to maintain international trade these governments must thus maintain low exit costs for a large proportion of their population.Laffer curve of tax rate versus tax revenue (black) and corresponding curve of GDP (green). When governments maximize tax revenue the prosperity and economic freedom of their taxpayers suffer. Credit: Mark Byron.Governments of almost any form try to maximize their tax revenues, and government employees also often gain personal satisfaction from being able to control the lives and property of others (this goes under various euphemisms, such as the ambitions to "change the world" and "make a difference.") This process is facilitated primarily by high exit costs and is limited almost only by limits on governmental ability to increase exit costs. The maximum point on theLaffer curve -- the most tax that a government can collect -- is lower and occurs at a lower percentage tax rate in countries where exit costs are low. Thus the tax rates inHong Kong, Singapore, and Bahrain are lower than among their culturally similar neighbors that do not specialize in as internationalimermediaries.At the other end of the spectrum from Hong Kong and Singapore are countries with isolated populations, with poor access to world communications and travel. Add to this countries where tax revenues can be gained from taxing agricultural land or minerals rather than potentially mobile "human capital." These countries tend to have the fewest freedoms. Even among highly developed countries, those with more homogeneous populations that speak a tongue seldom spoken outside the country -- and thus far stronger internal than international social ties -- tend to tax their "human capital" the most, e.g. the Scandinavian countries.In other words:(1) the governments of Singapore and Hong Kong have to encourage free travel to and from many other countries, to encourage the constant human interchange that is essential to international trade, making it impractical to set up onerous travel restrictions,(2) most residents of Singapore and Hong Kong have strong social ties -- both business and personal -- outside the country, and(3) the vast majority of residents of almost all other countries are tied to their territories by strong internal social networks and the lack of external social networks that could support them if they needed to escape. That makes it easy for governments to tax, regulate, and control the residents, for the same reason that it's easy for prison guards to abuse inmates -- it's hard to escape.The American colonies and the early American republic both had remarkably strong property rights and very low taxes by our standards, despite sharp changes in the form of government. With few changes in the form of government since, taxes have risen almost tenfold and property rights often now mean little more than the right to keep after-tax capital gains.The answer to this American puzzle is again exit costs. Farmland was the dominant form of wealth in the 18th and early 19th century, and practically free yet very good farmland was available in America on the western frontier. Any oppression, any high taxes or other violations of property rights could be countered by pulling up stakes and moving west. If you didn't want your local farmers to leave you had to respect their rights, in sharp contrast to the traditional form of agriculture where serfs were stuck on the land. On the other hand, black slaves in the U.S. provide a sharp contrast to the remarkably free white farmers -- a condition explained by state and federal fugitive slave laws, which spread a virtual Iron Curtain for slaves across the entire vast expanse of the United States, in free states as well as slave states.Human capital is very easy to tax when it gathers in large organizations, such as modern corporations, as these organizations must be audited, and auditing provides the information needed for the income tax, by far the most lucrative form of tax ever developed.   When America's frontier disappeared, when the good agricultural land was claimed and industrial wealth became more important than agricultural wealth, and industrial wealth was flowed in easily audited forms through corporations and to their employees, taxes rose and property rights for all started to erode, a process that continues to this day.Countries that depend on human capital, as almost every country these days does, often throw up legal barriers to exit. Countries that worry about "brain drain" sometimes charge extortionate passport fees. These are examples of countries erecting virtual Berlin walls in order to raise the exit costs of their countries, suppress jurisdictional competition, and thus increase their tax revenues.  Another form of this are long-arm statutes, especially when used to collect taxes on companies that have only "minimal contacts" with a jurisdiction.Why are governments imposed on us rather than chosen? Why can't we shop for countries like we shop for cars?  Why has progress in jurisdiction shopping movements such as the Free State Project been so slow?  Because interstate travel is considered a fundamental right under U.S. law, the exit costs imposed by law on moving from state to state are very low.   The slow progress of the Free State Project points up several factors:(1) that many, if not most, taxes and other violations of property rights considered onerous come from federal rather than local governments, and moving just from state to state within the United States does not avoid these,(2) that no state, not even New Hampshire, is so remarkably better than any other state to motivate many people to move, and(3) that local social ties -- whether for personal or business relationships -- are much more expensive for most people to break than the gains to be had from increased economic freedom between one state and another.In the United States and today in most of the world, exit costs are imposed primarily by the ways we live our lives -- and in particular by our personal and business networks -- not by artificial Berlin wall like barriers. Modern deprivations of liberty have much more to do with this fact than with the oftenexaggerated differences in forms of government or with supposedly crucial rights such as the right to vote. Today, never in the United States have so many people had the right to vote, yet never in the United States have we had so high taxes and so few property rights.With the fall of communism, for most people in the world government restrictions on exit are no longer the dominant barrier to exit.   Our lack of liberty has rather to do with the fact that the vast majority of our strong social ties lie within a territory monopolized by a nation-state. Any form of large modern nation-state that we can practically expect to encounter, as well as any state of any size that restricts emigration, will engage in extortionate deprivations of property that many people in many earlier times and places, such as colonial America, did not tolerate.How, then, can one best protect one's rights?  By living one's life in a way that makes exit costs low:Be prepared to vote with your feet. Add interstate and international diversity to your social networks -- both personal and business. Lower your costs of exiting, if the need should arise, the jurisdictions that impose on the territories wherein you reside. Repeatedly in history -- from the old American frontier to the fall of the Berlin Wall to modern jurisdictions that specialize in international trade -- low exit costs have not only enabled liberty for the individual and the small group, but they have more than any other factor motivated the larger jurisdiction to provide the most important rights and freedoms for those who stay put. Grow interpolitical roots so that no single polity can chop down your tree. The good news is that modern communications, travel, and standardization of international languages (mostly on English) have made diversifying our social networks -- growing international roots - far easier than ever before in history.Despite the closing of physical frontiers, which has had an extremely deleterious impact on freedom, other trends may be bringing about the lowering of exit costs. International communications networks and the international standardization on a few languages (and perhaps even just one, which quite fortunately for my readers is the one I'm currently writing in), combined with low international travel costs, are leading to the development of more strong personal and business social ties that cross borders. Multinational small businesses are joining multinational corporations in developing cross-border business ties.But there are also many threats by governments to re-establish or increase exit costs by throwing up virtual Berlin walls and fugitive taxpayer networks.  Extraterritorial assertions of jurisdiction, especially of tax jurisdiction, threaten to throw up enforcement networks akin to the old fugitive slave laws in the antebellum United States.   Freedom of travel is being threatened by paranoid responses to the overblown threat of terrorism -- but at least one good group is fighting to counter this threat. To counteract these threats, basic freedoms must be protected by our courts from encroachment by other governmental branches. The U.S. Supreme Court counts both voting and interstate travel as fundamental rights. Of these fundamental rights, travel -- but especially international travel -- the right to pass through the airports and Brandenburg Gates and Checkpoint Charlies of the world -- is by far the more important.
Another interesting protocol is cryptographic timestamping.  The purpose is to prove that a particular piece of content (i.e. some array of bits) existed at a particular period of time.   The basic idea goes back to the anagram publication technique that Robert Hooke, Galileo, and some other early scientists used to prove that they discovered certain things long before they published them.  When Hooke, for example, discovered his law of elasticity, he published the gobbledygook letters "ceiiinosssttuv."  Later, when he published his law of elasticity, he published "ut tensio sic vis" (as the extension, so with the force).  The earlier published anagram proved that he had discovered this law long before he published it.The modern protocol uses cryptographic hash functions instead of anagrams.  Any set of bits (digital content, a network event, whatever) is passed through the hash function, turning into into a unique random-looking string of bits.  Those bits are then published to multiple timestamp servers on the Internet.  The timestamp servers create a chain of hashes.  Using the chain of published hashes, it is easy to later prove that (1) the hash was published before one event and after another event, thus proving the time of publication, and (2) that the hash uniquely corresponds to a particular content.Note that the content of the file does not need to be published until proof is needed.  Thus, for example, one could digitally timestamp a secret digital inventor's notebook in order to prove later that the invention existed at that time.  (Might be quite useful under the American first-to-invent system).Indeed, using multiparty secure computation or the related protocols called zero-knowledge proofs, one can even make a later proof without publishing the content.   For example, if Bob received a secret encrypted e-mail message from Alice, Alice and Bob could prove to the world that Alice sent a message at 18:42:39 and Bob received it at 18:43:05 without revealing the actual contents of the message.  In a confidential audit of Alice's books based on securely timestamped transactions between Alice and Bob and Alice and Charles, performed using secure multiparty computation, Alice can prove to the auditor that her books balance based on real transactions with Bob and Charles, without revealing in unencrypted form to the auditor either the transactions or the books.  Such is the magical reality of cryptography!Here are some links to papers and other references on secure timestamping.
 There is a sense in which gene expression can be hierarchical: some genes are "master genes" that control the expression of many other genes.  In other words, they select which genes to express when.  It is thus entirely possible, and indeed in advanced organisms common, for a genome to encode a wide variety of phenotypes, only some of which get expressed, depending on the alleles of the master gene(s), on environmental cues, or both.   Master genes can control gender, sexual orientation, and a wide variety of other complex structures and behavioral tendencies encoded for by complex assemblies of genes.  The green beard effect occurs when linked genes produce all three of the following: (1) a signal, (2) recognition of that signal in others, and (3) different behaviors (e.g. altruism) towards those exhibiting that signal.   If the genes can remain linked, organisms expressing the green beard allele can cooperate with each other and spread in the population.  Most evolutionary biologists, studying the genetic evolution of behaviors in animals, have tended to dismiss green beard effects as rare, because they have only rarely been unambiguously observed in the field, and because it's highly unlikely that genes can remain linked in this manner during sexual recombination.I strongly suspect that this view is mistaken.  It's hard to distinguish green beard from normal ("blue beard") signalling and recognition systems (such as those involved in kin altruism, mother/fetus interfaces, sexual selection, gender recognition, etc.)  Green beard effects usually evolve "parasitically" on already existing "blue beard" signalling systems.  Both of these make it difficult to recognize green beard effects, because they are usually strongly associated with existing "blue beard" signalling systems.  Furthermore, strong linkages are not nearly as rare as has been assumed, because of the existence of master genes that control the expression of many other genes.  Alternative alleles of a master gene could, for example, code for the selective expression of alternative strategies encoded in many other genes.  In other words, a wide variety of genes, each existing in all members of a species, could code for two or more complex strategies, with a master gene coding for which of the strategies actually gets expressed.Nature provides a great example where I believe a master green beard gene is at work: the side-blotched lizard.  The male lizards have three different strategies for defending mates: dominance, sneakiness, and cooperative mate guarding.   Violating standard theory, these sexual strategies correspond to very distinct throat color patterns: orange, yellow, and blue.   Orange-throated lizards dominate a mate and territory and don't cooperate with other males in this task.  Yellow-throated lizards look and act like females, and sneak around cuckolding orange-throated lizards.  Blue-throated lizards cooperate to detect and fend off yellow lizards, but are weaker and can be defeated by yellow-throated lizards. The result is a kind of "rock-paper-scissors" game, where orange defeats blue, blue defeats yellow, and yellow defeats orange. The result is an evolutionarily stable situation in which no single color morph can dominate the population...The remarkable thing about the color morphs of side-blotched lizards is that an enormous range of behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits are correlated with throat color. Genes for different traits can be linked physically if they occur close together on a chromosome, but according to [evolutionary biologist Barry] Sinervo, throat color is linked to far more traits than could possibly be physically linked on the same chromosome.It's almost as if the whole genome is tightly tethered to this one master locus," he said. "In order to be a really 'good' blue, you have to have all these other alleles [of different genes] lined up in the right combination, and the same is true for orange and yellow color morphs. So there is strong selection for these different fitness combinations."The whole genome crystallizes into three types," Sinervo said. "The alleles for all these different traits should be independent and separated on the chromosomes, yet the genes are interacting through this one locus."The lizards, the throat color gene determining orange, yellow, or blue throat splotches seems to be tightly correlated to the rest of a distinct complex strategem. This is inexplicable by traditional arguments against the green beard, which assume that the alternative strategies are coded in three separate sets of alternative alleles, all of which must be expressed to work.  Being broken up and recombined every generation, they cannot stably evolve as distinct and competing sets of genes.  But the cooperation of the blue-throated lizards qualifies as a green beard effect, bringing this assumption into question.  The linkage of throat colors with complex behavioral strategies can be readily explained if all three strategies are encoded in all male side-blotched lizard genomes, and there is only one strong linkage, that is between the throat color gene and a gene that controls the expression of many other genes.   Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if the throat color gene and the master gene were the same gene.There are strong adaptive reasons for master genes to control complex assemblages in this way.  Behavioral strategies, and indeed structures and metabolic pathways, that are too complicated but not ubiquitous in a breeding population are encoded across too many unlinked genes. As a result they cannot survive sexual recombination. All advanced multi-cellular organisms thus have master genes or distinct chromosomes that control the expression of many other genes.  In the case of gender, distinct chromosomes are usually involved, but master genes can behave similarly, producing small sets of complicated  strategies, each strategy very distinct from each other and each a distinct alternative to the other. In information theory terms, there is a large information distance between each of the alternative strategies, just as there are many differences between the genes expressed in the development of a female versus those expressed in a male.  A wide variety of distinct morphological and behavioral traits are bundled into a small number (in the case of genders, typically two) of alternatives. A wide variety of other genes encode the distinct complex structures or strategies, to be invoked by master genes, developmental stages, and environmental cues.   Since the complicated parts of each strategy are encoded in every member of the breeding population, there is no problem with sexual recombination breaking linkages between many genes encoding each strategy: each gene of each strategy is still there waiting, in the next generation, to be invoked by the master gene.I strongly suspect that master genes and green beard effects analyzed in this manner will shed light on a wide variety of puzzles in evolutionary biology, including sexual selection, sexual orientation, and racial and ethnic preferences that, under the assumption that green beard effects are not important, have long defied analysis or been assumed to be purely environmental.
The biggest problem we face with the frontier below that we're literally in the dark.   We have a number of crude geophysical techniques (seismology, gravity field, electromagnetic, etc.) but none of them allow creating a detailed map like we can make of the surface of a distant moon of Saturn or even of a cloud-covered planet like Venus.   So in some important ways we are more ignorant of the ground a few hundred meters down in most places on our own planet than we are of the surface of most of the other planets and moons in our solar system.   We know less about the distribution of the common molecules below the earth's crust, only 35 kilometers below our feet, than we do of the distribution of those molecules on the surfaces of dust clouds in distant galaxies.  One possible fix to this earth-blindness is the neutrino, and more speculatively and generally, dark matter.  We can detect neutrinos and anti-neutrinos by (I'm greatly oversimplifying here, physicists please don't cringe) setting up big vats of clear water in complete darkness and lining them with ultra-sensitive cameras.  The feature of neutrinos is that they rarely interact with normal matter, so that most of them can fly from their source (nuclear reactions in the earth or sun) through the earth and still be detected.  The bug is that almost all of them fly through the detector, too.   Only a tiny fraction hit a nucleus in the water and interact, giving off a telltale photon (a particle of light) which is picked up by one of the cameras.   It is common now to detect neutrinos from nuclear reactors and the sun, and more recently we have started using some crude instruments to detect geo-neutrinos (i.e. neutrinos or anti-neutrinos generated by the earth not the sun).  With enough vats and cameras we may be able to detect enough of these (anti-)neutrinos from nuclear reactions (typically radioactive decays) in the earth's crust to make a detailed radioisotope map (and thus go a long way towards a detailed chemical map) of the earth's interior.  For the first time we'd have detailed pictures of the earth's interior instead of very indirect and often questionable inferences.   A 3D Google Earth.    These observatories may also be a valuable intelligence tool, detecting secret nuclear detonations and reactors being used to construct nuclear bomb making material, via the tell-tale neutrinos these activities give off. Other forms of weakly interacting particles, the kind that probably make up dark matter, may be much more abundant but interact even more weakly than neutrinos.  So weakly we haven't even detected them yet.  They're just the best theory we have to explain why galaxies hang together: if they consisted only of the visible matter they should fly apart.   Nevertheless, depending on what kinds of dark particles we discover, and on what ways they weakly interact with normal matter, we may find more ways of taking pictures of the earth's interior. What might we find there?  One possibility: an abundance of hydrogen created by a variety of geological reactions and sustained by the lack of oxygen.  Scientists have discovered that the predominant kinds of rocks in the earth's crust contain quite a bit of hydrogen  trapped inside them: on average about five liters of hydrogen per cubic meter of rock.    This probably holds at least to the bottom of the lithosphere.   If so that region contains about 150 million trillion liters of hydrogen.  Sufficiently advanced neutrino detectors might be able to see this hydrogen via its tritium, which when it decays gives off a neutrino.  Tritium with its half-life of about 12 years is very rare, but is created when a more common hydrogen isotope, deuterium, captures a neutrino from a more common nuclear event (the decay of radioisotopes that are common in the earth's crust).  About one-millionth of the deuterium in the heavy water moderating a nuclear reactor is converted into tritium in a year.  This rate will be far less in the earth's interior but still may be significant enough compared to tritium's half-life that a sufficiently sensitive and calibrated (with respect to the much greater stream of such neutrinos coming from the sun) neutrino detector of the future may detect hydrogen via such geotritium-generated neutrinos.   However, the conversion of deuterium to tritium in the earth's core may be so rare that we will be forced to infer the abundance of hydrogen from the abundance of other elements.  Almost all elements have radioisotopes that give off neutrinos when they decay, and most of these are probably much more common in the earth's core than tritium.Another possibility for detecting hydrogen is, instead of looking for geo-neutrinos, to look at how the slice of earth one wants to study absorbs solar neutrinos.   This would require at least two detectors, one to look at the (varying) unobstructed level of solar neutrinos and the other lined up so that the geology being studied is between that detector and the sun.   This differential technique may work even better if we have a larger menagerie of weakly interacting particles ("dark matter") to work with, assuming that variations in nuclear structure can still influence how these particles interact with matter.It's possible that a significant portion the hydrogen known to be locked into the earth's rocks has been freed or can be freed merely by the process of drilling through that rock, exposing the highly pressurized hydrogen in deep rocks to the far lower pressures above.   This is suggested by the Kola Superdeep Borehole, one of those abandoned Cold War super-projects.  In this case instead of flying rockets farther than the other guy, the goal was to drill deeper than the other guy, and the Soviets won this particular contest: over twelve kilometers straight down, still the world record.  They encountered something rarely encountered in shallower wells: a "large quantity of hydrogen gas, with the mud flowing out of the hole described as 'boiling' with hydrogen."The consequences of abundant geologic hydrogen could be two-fold.  First, since a variety of geological and biological processes convert hydrogen to methane (and the biological conversion, by bacteria appropriately named "methanogens", is the main energy source for the deep biosphere, which probably substantially outweighs the surface biosphere), it suggests that our planet's supply of methane (natural gas) is far greater than of oil or currently proven natural gas reserves, so that (modulo worries about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) our energy use can continue to grow for many decades to come courtesy of this methane.     Second, the Kola well suggests the possibility that geologic hydrogen itself may become an energy source, and one that frees us from having to put more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  The "hydrogen economy" some futurists go one about, consisting of fuel-cell-driven machinery, depends on making hydrogen which in turn requires a cheap source of electricity.  This is highly unlikely unless we figure out a way to make nuclear power much cheaper.  But by contrast geologic hydrogen doesn't have to be made, it only has to be extracted and purified. If just ten percent of the hydrogen in the lithosphere turns out to be recoverable over the next 275 years, that's enough by my calculations to enable a mild exponential growth in energy usage of 1.5%/year over that entire period (starting with the energy equivalent usage of natural gas today).  During most of that period human population is expected to be flat or falling, so practically that entire increase would be in per capita usage.  To put this exponential growth in perspective, at the end of that period a person would be consuming, directly or indirectly, about 330 times as much hydrogen energy as they consume in natural gas energy today.   And since it's hydrogen, not hydrocarbon, burning it would not add any more carbon to the atmosphere, just a small amount of water.Luckily our drilling technology is improving: the Kola well took nearly two decades to drill at a leisurely pace of about 2 meters per day.   Modern oil drilling often proceeds at 200 meters/day or higher, albeit not to such great depths.  Synthetic diamond, used to coat the tips of the toughest drills, is much cheaper than during the Cold War and continues to fall in price, and we have better materials for withstanding the high temperatures and pressures encountered when we get to the bottom of the earth's crust and proceeding into the upper mantle (where the Kola project got stymied: their goal was 15 kilometers down).A modern drill bit studded with polycrystalline diamondOf course, I must stress that the futuristic projections given above are quite speculative.  We may not figure out how to affordably build a network of neutrino detecting vats massive enough or of high enough precision to create detailed chemical maps of the earth's interior.  And even if we create such maps, we may discover not so much hydrogen, or that the hydrogen is hopelessly locked up in the rocks and that the Kola experience was a fluke or misinterpretation.   Nevertheless, if nothing else this exercise shows, despite all the marvelous stargazing science that we have done, how much mysterious ground we have below our shoes.
Orbital Express has demonstrated a number of interesting techniques of great long-term importance, such as the automated refueling of spacecraft.   (Here is the biggest long-term reason why automated and on-orbit assembly and refueling are important).  But the mission also demonstrated the feasibility of an idea that is probably also of great but nearer-term importance, which I call mobile redundancy.   The idea is that if one has a constellation of standard satellites, redundancy can be provided with mobile spare parts rather than by building on-board redunancy into each satellite as is done now.  This could result in a large overall savings in weight launched per year of useful satellite lifetime.
Bryan Caplan has a great article on the irrationality of voters. (No, it's not a commentary on the most recent American election, which was probably a smidgen more rational than most, on balance). The basic idea, which I find unimpeachable except in one area, is that voters are almost never foreseeably impacted by their own votes. Single votes almost never change the outcome of elections. Even if they did they would rarely impact the voter or others in a way the voter clearly foresees. Given this disconnect between vote and consequence, votes instead are based on how good they make the voter feel. People vote in the first place, and then decide what to vote on, based almost entirely on their emotional needs rather than on a rational analysis of the kind that, for example, an engineer brings to designing software, an economist brings to crafting monetary policy, a lawyer brings to drafting a contract, a judge brings to interpreting law, or even that a boss or HR person brings to hiring a new employee.I'd add that people use their political opinions to signal things they'd like their acquaintances to believe about their personality. For example, people support aid to the poor to signal to their friends and co-workers that they are generous people, and thus good people to be friends or co-workers with. The actual impact of any resulting policy on poor people or taxpayers or others generally remains unobserved by friends and co-workers and thus is irrelevant. Even if a friend believes the policy is mistaken, but that the opiner's heart is in the right place, this is sufficient for successful signaling. It's coming across as having a genuine desire to help the poor that counts. Similarly, people are motivated to vote in order to signal their altruistic participation in the community.   The one area Caplan fails to explore is very small-scale elections. I've long thought that juries, for example, are a much better example of democracy than large-scale elections. Jurors are forced to take the time to learn the facts (thus overcoming rational ignorance) and have a real case at hand (thus overcoming much of the mismatch between social signaling to ignorant friends and reality). They can clearly foresee the impact their verdict will have on the defendant. While Caplan extols the virtues of judges and other experts like himself (he'd like to have a Supreme Court of Economists to overturn bad economic legislation), such a Platonic oligarchy of experts needs to be checked and balanced by democracy. Juries, and the right of juries to judge law as well as fact (and for lawyers to argue law as well as fact in front of the jury), along with an unimpeachable right to trial by jury, are a much better way than large-scale elections to check oligarchy.
I have extensively explored the technological codification of certain aspects of law -- law that is "smart" as in "smart weapons". These could implement in digital protocol important parts of law that are now processed by the mind via legal language or through physical enforcement. My focus has been on smart contracts, smart property, and other such technological reifications of private law. Here I explore the dangerous territory of extending these ideas to public law, especially to governmental forms and legal procedures. Officials of a wide variety of governments have too often over the course of history covered up or falsified evidence, destroyed or forged public records, and introduced other lies into legal and political processes. We need to protect future legal procedures and other governmental operations from such abuses.The canonical problem explored by computer scientists in designing these protocols, the Byzantine Generals Problem, is itself an exercise about liars in government. This article focuses on technologically ensuring the veracity and execution of those steps of legal procedure which are capable of such enhancement (formalizeable or objective aspects which I call "dry", in contrast to the many inherently subjective and non-syntactical "wet" aspects of the law): securing chains of evidence, securing chains of command, securely recording and publicizing the ownership and transfer of property, and so on.A set of ideas I have for procedural law, or "government" broadly defined, is that many of its dry steps might be based on Byzantine fault tolerance protocols along with cryptographic protocols that form tamper-evident structures such as unforgeable chains of evidence. I describe some of these and related protocols further here, here, and here, but I will describe the basic idea of Byzantine fault tolerance here.The basic idea of a Byzantine fault tolerant protocol is that it is a highly distributed peer-to-peer protocol robust from a certain fraction or less of its participants lying about information originally observed or created by one or a small subset of them. The fraction varies based on various assumptions of the model, but common figures are 1/3 and 1/2 for information originating from one node assuming that node is truthful. If the fraction required for successful collusive lying is not achieved (and such an attack requires either informed negotiations occurring before this protocol step or negotiating the collusion in a single step, the latter possible to avoid by assuming fraud if messaging is abnormally delayed), the liars are detected and can be excluded from future participation in the network. In a less formal sense, Byzantine fault tolerant protocols are simply distributed, peer-to-peer networks with dense communications (in the least efficient but most secure versions, every node sends every bit of information to ever other node) in order to protect against minorities of colluding liars, and to detect and exclude any liars who have not reached the threshold of collusion and thus can be excluded from the network.Byzantine fault tolerance protocols are not as strong as cryptographic protocols. They can also suffer from the sock puppet problem (also called in some literature the "Sybil" problem), in which one or a few liars control a much larger and sufficient fraction of network nodes, if the participants are not strongly identified as unique individuals. Thus where it is possible, we should augment these dense peer-to-peer protocols with or use instead stronger cryptographic schemes such as hashing and a variety of cryptographic signatures. If the Byzantine protocol is overcome by collusive liars in a way that cannot be detected before sufficient collusion occurs or prevented by cryptography, some outside manual "meta-protocol" is required to figure out who is lying and repair the network or create a new network containing the truthful state. For some kinds of communications, digital signatures and a chain of evidence based on cryptographic hash chains are a much stronger security against forgery. Byzantine protocols, with their imperfect detection and exclusion of liars, are to be relied on only where the lie is of a nature not amenable to prevention by cryptographic chains of evidence.Sensors and effectors can be readily hooked up to these high-integrity networks. Cryptography can, for example, provide us an unforgeable chain of evidence from a security camera to our computer displays and an unforgeable return chain of command from our mice to a gun or a jail cell lock. Cryptography can also secure smart contracts with the local officials: a judge declares you bailable, said authorization being transmitted to your jail door. Your girlfriend fills out a web form which pays the bail bondsman with a credit card. The bondsman's computer debits her account and then puts up the digital bond, and the jail door opens. You're out and I don't get to date your kind-hearted girlfriend. One popular piece of secure government that many people have worked on is secure voting.Several years ago I sketched an important sub-protocol of liar-resistant government, namely secure property titles (or, more generally, secure public registries). Such titles could, of course, include titles to political as well as real, personal, and intellectual property, and physical security devices such as sensors and weapons could be controlled based on them. In addition to to the cryptographic integrity of the records themselves, the public title registry can follow any rules of transfer in at least a Byzantine failure resistant way. Normal title transfers, signed over by the former owner, would be cryptographically strong.Besides the obvious real property titles, domain names, and so, on, these registries could securely record and transfer the shares of a corporation. Bit gold, my sketch of an electronic currency that minimally relies on trust in any one person or organization, achieves this minimal vulnerability by using secure property titles. Satoshi Nakamoto has implemented BitCoin which very similarly uses a dense Byzantine fault tolerant peer-to-peer network and and cryptographic hash chains to ensure the integrity of a currency.Making a number of important legal and political functions liar-resistant is on the horizon, and bits and pieces of this task are already being implemented.
A "liberty" (Latin libertatis or freedom) in the king's courts of medieval Europe usually referred something very different than it refers to now. It referred to the right of someone to deprive some other people of some of their normal rights as law-abiding subjects. In other words, it referred to a political property, a specifically limited right to coerce some set of people, usually for law enforcement or military or other political purposes. This curious meaning, in some ways quite the opposite of our modern meaning, reflects the conundrum that one person may use some freedoms to deprive another person of their freedoms. To prevent this, these "positive" freedoms to coerce can be limited to procedural powers by which are enforced substantive laws that are generally non-coercive, i.e. that generally protect only "negative" rights. English-derived common law (i.e. law in Great Britain, the Commonwealth, the United States, etc.) since at least the sixteenth century has generally accomplished this, and as we shall see it has used the flexibility of vague phrases to evolve a variety of modern negative rights.Medieval positive liberties that could be owned included the right of a lord to hang thieves caught red-handed in his territory, the right to hold a market and run a law-merchant court, to collect taxes for the king or for oneself, to be a privateer (i.e. a pirate legitimized under the king's laws), to conquer and run a foreign territory, and so on. There were many dozens of kinds of these political properties specified in thousands of property deeds, called charters. Charters often freely bundled real property (i.e. land) with a variety of political properties over territories matching the boundaries of the real property, but on occasion political properties could be unbundled from land, and specific kinds of political property could be combined with each other in a dizzying variety of ways. Political properties could be held by individuals (as in lords of the manor, counties Palatine, the proprietary American Colonies, and many other examples) or corporations (guilds, boroughs, cities like London and York, companies like the East India Company, the corporate American colonies, and so on).Individually owned politcal properties were generally hereditary. The king exercised his own hereditary political property, called the Realm or the Crown, from which at least in theory all other political property rights had been originally granted. As the original grantor the king retained via his courts jurisdiction over disputes involving those coercive properties, via the extraordnary or prerogative writs. Most political property rights only involved certain narrow subsets of the royal political powers, while some (such as the county Palatine) were very broad, including all royal powers within the boundaries of the county subject only to the intrusion of the king's extraordinary writs.In the foreign relations context, in the granting of powers of naval warfare, piracy, and colonization, political property was used for offense as much as for defense. In the domestic context, justice was meted out by these privately owned courts more often than injustice, but it should be observed that breaking free of the jurisdiction of the local lord in order to come under the jurisdiction of the king was, more than any other event, referred to as gaining one's "freedom". If you were the subject of a lord as well as, mostly indirectly, of the king, you were "unfree". If you were the subject of only the king and his ministers, you were "free". At least that is how the king's courts and ministers and any newspapermen that didn't want to be imprisoned for libel by the king's courts referred to it.In their quest to usurp the political properties of the lords, boroughs, cities, and guilds to run their local courts, the king's courts used cases brought under the extraordinary writs to evolve a set of "liberties" with a different meaning: liberties the way most of us think of them, negative liberties that individuals held against these private law enforcers as subjects of the king, and thus justified removal of the cases to the king's courts. The definitions of various political properties increasingly included the procedures within which those rights to coerce had to be exercsed in order to protect the king's subjects from injustice.  Thus we see, for example, over the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries the king's courts successively stripping guilds of various of their jurisdictional powers and thereby increasing the liberty of the individual to freely engage in their trade.  To try to be consistent, the king's judges also often, though by no means always, respected these negative liberties themselves in order to justify by rules their usurpation of the positive liberties of rival private courts.Many of the basic constitutional rights of individuals, for example of the rights enshrined in the U.S. Bill of Rights, descend from these efforts. The lex mercatoria evolved in the privately owned market courts of Western Europe. Much of this merchant law was later incorporated into the common law (the law of the king's courts) in Great Britain by merchant juries in the century leading up to the industrial revolution. At the same time, the king's courts gained a large degree of independence from both the king and the rising power of Parliament, forming a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches that was to be used as a model for the United States Constitution.Lord Coke, Chief Justice of the king's court of Common Pleas under King James I in the early seventeenth century, declared in Dr. Bonham's Case that these common law rights could even limit the power of Parliament, but this argument came to be neglected by later courts. There has been longstanding debate over whether this argument of Coke's was a legally binding "holding" necessary to reach the verdict of the case or an unecessary "dictum" and thus not binding precedent.  A similar doctrine was, however, revived in the United States based on interpreting broad statements in our Constitution such as "due process" in terms of rights derived from English common law in order to limit the powers of Congress and the President. The term "due process" comes from a series of charters that followed the Great Charter (Magna Carta). The phrase was considered largely synonymous with "the law of the land" that features in the Magna Carta, and referred to procedural rights, including the rights of political property and procedural limitations on those rights, that were considred the "common law" at that time. However the United States' courts' much later interpretation of the phrase has been far more creative and modern, including the oxymoronic phrase "substantive due process" under which rights to freedom of contract, school choice, birth control, and abortion, among other such negative personal rights, have been unearthed and applied to limit State and Federal legislative and executive powers. (More on the history of due process here). The modern British Parliament, on the other hand, is considered to have arbitrary sovereign powers, which can only be limited in certain cases by interpreting the language of its statutes in narrow ways to conform with the unwritten British constitution, i.e. its procedural common law traditions, but again with many creative modern flourishes.In their efforts to limit locally coercive liberties by enhancing negative liberties, the king's courts fell short of consistency in some important ways. For example, a liberty of a corporation to enforce its regulations about a given subject matter (e.g. medicine, for a medical guild) in a given territory was often stripped from that corporation in a case involving a dispute between an individual and that corporation (e.g. somebody practicing medicine in the territory without permission of the guild), on the theory that "one should not be a judge in his own case." This is a very sound principle, and in the case of the guilds it led to the rise of free trade, but as the corporate barristers were quick to point out, the king's courts often did not apply this principle to themselves -- cases involving the king, which were many, remained in the king's courts.   To some extent this was achieved by the independence of the king's courts, but it did not prevent these courts from gradually usurping the political property of the private courts and other privately held legal institutions and, with the generous help of Parliament and its own will to power, eventually extirpating them. There is a detailed analysis of many English cases involving privately owned rights to hold courts and enforce laws, including Dr. Bonham's Case, in my paper Jurisdiction as Property.

The writ of habeas corpus is an order from a national court to a local entity that has imprisoned a person to (1) produce that person at the national court, and (2) provide that court with a good reason for the imprisonment. Habeas corpus is is an extraordinary writ, and for that reason runs much farther than the normal jurisdiction of the national court. The local entity commanded by the writ can be any entity within the nation, or any within any territory of that nation (including military bases), or on any of the nation's ships at sea: any entity at all that claims the right to detain people. Habeas corpus is almost a millennium old, and in various forms it is probably much older. It has been and remains the main way by which legal rights against the arbitrary detention of a person by any kind of entity are enforced. Habeas corpus well deserves its other traditional name: the Great Writ.Two cases help illustrate how crucial habeas corpus has been to the development of liberty. The core meaning of the word "liberty" itself is simply freedom from bodily constraint without due process of law. For many hundreds of years in legal systems derived from English law, habeas corpus has been the main, and often the only, mechanism by which this most essential of freedoms has been enforced.Dr. Bonham's Case, in 1610, played a key role both in the history of American and Commonwealth constitutional law and in the ending of the power of the guilds. Guilds were somewhat like labor unions or business cartels, but often with an extra power -- the power to themselves convict and imprison those operating in the guild's business.Besides guild courts, there were a large number and variety of other franchise courts in England: church courts, merchant's courts, manorial courts, mining courts, colonial courts, municipal courts, the courts of private counties, and so on. The king's courts generally had no jurisdiction to hear appeals from franchise or military courts except by extraordinary writ -- the most important of which was habeas corpus. Dr. Bonham was imprisoned by the London physician's guild for practicing medicine in London without their license. Habeas corpus made it possible for Dr. Bonham to appeal his imprisonment. The Court freed Dr. Bonham, holding that his due process rights had been violated by the guild: the guild's conviction had not been obtained before a proper court.Somerset's Case, in 1772, played a crucial role in the abolition of slavery. Somerset was a (former, it was argued) slave (formerly) owned by a merchant from the American colonies. When Somerset escaped from his master, he was recaptured and put on a boat for the British territory of Jamaica. An abolitionist petitioned on Somerset's behalf for habeas corpus, which Lord Mansfield granted. Still on the high seas, the writ of habeas corpus ordered the British captain to bring Somerset to London to be produced before the King's Bench. Slavery was no ordinary kind of property: it was also a deprivation of bodily liberty. As such, habeas corpus made it possible for the slave to challenge his status as bodily detained property. The high court's writ of habeas corpus reached far beyond Great Britain to the United Kingdom's colonies and its ships as sea. Once Parliament banned slavery across the British Empire, the Great Writ was crucial in implementing the ban to abolish slavery throughout that globe-spanning enterprise.The Great Writ has been often been suspended in areas and periods of warfare, leading to great abuse but also to the ability to efficiently and ruthlessly fight the war without the legal overhead. The U.S. Constitution specifies that habeas corpus may be suspended only by Congress, and only with respect to invasion or rebellion (it may not be suspended domestically due to a foreign war or mere domestic crime), and even then only so long as public safety requires the suspension. Article I (listing the powers of Congress) states:The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it. Art. I, Â§9, cl. 2. More about the habeas corpus , military detention, and the Military Commissions Act coming soon in a subsequent post.UPDATE: Here are  some subsequent posts on habeas corpus and the MCA:The Lex Gabina: ancient Military Commissions Act?Liberty and habeas corpus (II)
Here is a good book review of Robert A. Pape's Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism. Pape has done extensive research on suicide bombers and concluded that the main motivation is not poverty or religion but nationalism.  (Note that Pape and I are using "nation" to refer to supra-tribal ethnic groups which share at least a common language and common political ambition to run its own government, not necessarily to existing or historical states).  Pape shows that suicide terrorism springs from perceived or actual occupations of one national group by a different and democratically governed one: Sri Lanka and India of Tamil regions (the Tamil Tigers), perceived Western proxy governments of Sunni Arab countries (Al Qaeda), a Shiite government allied to the U.S. invaders of Sunni areas in Iraq (Sunni insurgency), Israel of the Palestinian occupied territories (Hamas), etc. The strategic logic (as I liberally interpret Pape's theory) is that the suicide bombers credibly signal policymakers in democratic governments that the the national group cares far more about the conflict than the occupiers do -- and therefore are willing to sacrifice far more and make life far more difficult for occupiers. Pape points out that (at the time of writing of the book) the most suicide bombers came not from Al Quaeda or any other arguably religious terrorist group, but from the Marxist-Leninist (and thus atheist) Tamil Tigers. It can of course be argued that Marxism itself is a kind of religion, but at least Paper debunks the shallow idea that afterlife promises a la the "seventy virgins" are a necessary motivation for suicidal terrorism. I'd add that suicide terrorism grows from cultures that de-emphasize individualism -- thus the lack of, for example, ethnically European suicide bombers, but the historical existence of Middle Eastern and Japanese suicide fighters which Pape describes. We individualists have not been able to understand suicide bombers; they just seemed inexplicably crazy. Pape's analysis is an excellent antidote to this ignorance.The movie "Jesus Camp" shows a fundamentalist Christain group trying to inculcate in their children the idea that Christians should also be willing to make extreme sacrifices in the cause of Christian crusade against Islam. If the West insists on occupying non-individualist national groups (for example most of the nations subscribing to Islam or Marxism), something like this indeed probably is necessary to be successful. But Christianity, with its emphasis on the individual soul, and the rest of the Western tradition is far too individualist for this (and for other reasons, which far outweigh the terrorist problem, this is a very good thing).The lesson for Western foreign policy? (1) don't occupy non-individualist regions -- the costs will be far more expensive then we can imagine -- although you'd think we would have already learned this from the Vietnam and current Iraqi experiences; and (2) if you already are in such an occupation, the basic choices of remaining or leaving are both very expensive -- the former because it continues to motivate extreme nationalist ire, and the latter because it encourages national groups elsewhere by showing that suicide terrorism succeeds in its objectives. It's like paying off a kidnapper, which frees the current hostages but makes future kidnappings more likely. Withdrawing from occupation removes a current source of ire but shows national groups elsewhere that suicide terrorism is the best way to achieve the objectives of otherwise powerless nationalities.This Hobson's choice reinforces why a decision to occupy is so expensive in the first place. We are no longer in a situation in which it's our literate and culturally unified armed forces against their illiterate and culturally and politically divided tribe, as during the era of colonization. Instead it's our literate and unified nations against their literate and unified nations, the only big differences being our mere superiority on a traditional battlefield and their much higher motivation and collectivism, and thus their much higher willingness to sacrifice individuals for the cause of the large national group. Occupation of national regions that have not yet been thoroughly Westernized (or are not otherwise individualistic) is no longer a politically viable use of force in our world. If we wish to convert collectivist nations to Western democracy, individualism, Christianity, or whatever else we'd like to teach them, our best strategy is to just use our dominant Western economy and media to be, as Reagan put it, a "Shining City on a Hill".  That's how we brought down the Marxist and nuclear-armed Soviet Union.  Focus on defending our own freedoms instead of trying to impose them, set a good example, and let the collectivists peacefully come to realize the advantages of individualism.
Adam Smith observed how even the most basic of products in 1776, at the dawn of the industrial revolution in Britain, depended, directly and indirectly, on the work of thousands of people:Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or day-laborer in a civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of people of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been employed in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woollen coat, for example, which covers the day laborer, as coarse and rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labor of a great multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very distant part of the country! How much commerce and navigation in particular, how many shipbuilders, sailors, sailmakers, ropemakers, must have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the world! What a variety of labor, too, is necessary in order to produce the tools of the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labor is requisite in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house, the brickmaker, the bricklayer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the forger, the smith, must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were we to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears nest his skin, the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all the different parts which compose it, the kitchen grate at which be prepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose, dug from the bowels of the earth, and brought to him perhaps by a long sea and a long land carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the furniture of his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals, the different hands employed in preparing his bread and his beer, the glass window which lets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the wind and the rain, with all the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy invention, without which these northern parts of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation, together with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing those different conveniences; if we examine, I say, all these things, and consider what a variety of labor is employed about each of them, we shall be sensible that without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the very meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided [emphasis added], even according to what we may falsely imagine the easy and simple manner in which he is commonly accommodated. Leonard Read used the pencil as an even more startling example of how a simple 20th century product depended on a vast global network of economic relations.  The number of people required, directly and indirectly, to manufacture a high-technology device, such as a cellphone or laptop computer, is probably in the millions.  Friedrich Hayek explained the fine-grained division of labor that makes modern technology and wealth possible as a division of knowledge in "The Use of Knowledge in Society":The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate "given" resources—if "given" is taken to mean given to a single mind which deliberately solves the problem set by these "data." It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know.Yet there existed a culture, the pre-European Polynesians, which established self-sufficient economies sometimes not totalling more than a few hundred people on dozens of small islands int the Pacific.   Due to the small number of people that made up a self-sufficient economy, they did it using technology and institutions radically different from the agricultural civilizations of the Eurasian continent where they had come from.  The Polynesians did not work metal: metalworking (for example the mining, smelting, smithing, etc. required to extract and work iron) requires too much of a division of labor.  They used only the materials readily available on a South Seas island: their houses, ovens, boats, weapons, etc. were all made out of plants, stones, and animal parts.  Since they lived at a Malthusian equilibrium (which almost every culture lived under until northwest Europe in the 17th century started a long climb out of it), their standard of living was on average the same as the world average -- dirt poor by our standards.   This was enough, however, to produce catamarans that could navigate the South Pacific long before Magellan and Cook.  Small island economies greatly increased the premium and resulting emphasis on trade between islands in Polynesia and Melanesia (the Melanesians were an earlier group of island settlers).   When inter-island trade was feasible, large proportions of resources and attention went into it.  The kula ring was a splendid example of a sophisticated trade institution that developed among some of the Melanesians.What's more, the Polynesians could do something that we moderns cannot -- replicate their entire economy from one island to another by packing up their families, along with a variety of plants and a handful of animals, onto a handful of catamarans.  Could we similarly replicate our entire modern global economy, or a set of tools that could produce an equivalent result, to, say, another planet on a handful of rockets?    That was the ambition of K. Eric Drexler's nanotechnology: pack a rocket full of "assemblers": self-replicating robots that can make almost anything.   In the mid-20th century, mathematician and computer scientist John Von Neumann sketched a theoretical model of a self-replicating machine -- a self-replicating pattern in the 2-dimensional world of "cellular automata" (where, among other simplifications, copy operations come for free). I have long been skeptical of the idea that physical self-replication can be done with a simple design:While going from macroscopic industrial parts proposed by von Neumann, or the nucleic acids, amino acids and myriad of tertiary biochemicals in bacteria, to atomic-scale diamondoid parts reduces the search space, and thus complexity, but this also reduces the degrees of design freedom. It could be that the search space of diamondoid replicators is so small that there is no possible configuration of, say, 10 million carbon atoms can copy itself in practice, when we get down to the details of atomic placement in each operation. A particularly difficult task in atomic placement for one small segement of a Stewart platform (eg assembling the ratchet complex) may necessitate a blowup in the complexity of the platform itself or in the machinery that brings molecules to and places them for the platform. To be truly self-replicating we need to close all the loops in the graph of operations. Attempts to close the last 1% ("vitamins") might introduce even more open loops than we close. The minimum complexity might easily exceed the degrees of freedom in the search space, in which case a solution does not exist. The seeming simplicity of the the small-island Polynesian economy, lacking a sophisticated division of production and distribution operations and thus lacking a highly complex division of knowledge, is in one sense an illusion.  This simplicity was made possible by making intensive use of very high evolved plant life.   The complexity of life is extremely high.   The self-sufficiency of the pre-European Polynesian economy is only possible if agriculture can be productively accomplished with tools made by the farmer or his friends.   There is no simple design of a pan-assembler or self-replicating device -- the simplest ones we know of, life, are of extremely high complexity, and it will be a long time before we create new versions of life, much less artificial self-replicating machinery, in a lab.Partially self-replicating machines are, of course, quite possible.  The actual direct and indirect labor required for these machines, like those required for laptops and cell phones, is in the millions of people, and for many of the same reasons -- these machines are based on sophisticated microchips and plastics, among other parts of complex origin.  Even if we radically redesigned every tool and machine we have for our hypothetical self-sufficient extraterrestrial economy -- and such radical redesign would be utterly necessary -- it would still likely require hundreds of thousands of people and gigatonnes of machinery, at least, to have a wealthy yet self-sufficient economy beyond earth.  Take Smith's coat and Read's pencil, elaborate the required network still further for today's complex products, and multiply by many thousands of products -- that is what is required to fill the shelves of your hardware super-store (in the U.S., Home Depot and Lowe's).  Do this again for your drugstore, your clothing store, etc.  You'd have no such super-stores in our space colony.   It would in many ways be quite poor by earth standards. The Polynesians relied on the ready availability of high-evolved life that could readily be grown in the native environment (no complex artificial creations like Plexiglass domes or grow-lights needed), and yet were dirt-poor by our standards.  Modern products generally require elaborate divisions of labor necessarily involving millions of people.   Such an economy cannot be planned, as numerous attempts to do so demonstrated in the 20th century.  A modern economy requires a decentralized information-transmitting mechanism such as a market to work.   In sharp contrast to the Polynesian small-island economy, our global economy cannot be easily replicated.  We have to make it work here, or nowhere.
In the early 15th century, two nations at opposite ends of the world -- one vast and the other tiny, one an ancient and advanced civilization and the other recently emerged from a barbaric Dark Ages, one fielding large fleets with large ships, the other fielding small fleets with small ships -- both set out on the sea. Told that one of these nations was destined to travel around Africa and conquer the main sea trade routes of the world by the early part of the 16th century, any rational observer would conclude that this prophecy must refer to the vast and ancient civilization with its giant fleets. That observer would have been wrong. But why?The vast nation, the Chinese Empire, sent abroad vast naval flotillas -- the Zheng He fleets. The main purpose of these fleets was not to develop trade, nor to protect trade, nor even to conquer. Instead, the main purpose was simply to display the glory of the Chinese Empire, which as everyone already knew was indeed the most glorious and powerful empire on the planet. A quite secondary purpose was to collect tribute, which came nowhere near the levels needed to fund the fleets.Size of a Zheng He "treasure ship" vs. a typical Portuguese or Spanish caravel (here Columbus' Santa Maria).These state fleets operated completely independently of the vibrant private Chinese merchant fleets that traded not only off China with Japan and Korea and the Philippines, but in Indonesia, Indochina, India, and as far as the east coast of Africa. Zheng He did not help to either protect, expand, or otherwise enable this trade. Instead Zheng He, a eunuch and master bureaucrat of the Emperor, sailed his vast fleet as far as Africa accomplishing little more than showing off the glory of the Emperor and collecting exotic animals for his amusement.All it took was a political change for the bureaucracy to realize that these expeditions were far too expensive and ultimately pointless. But, as often occurs with politics, the Emperor overreacted and banned not only Zheng He's "treasure fleets," but also the productive trade of the Chinese merchants. The last "treasure fleet" returned in 1433 and China soon withdrew on itself.A million-yuan giraffe, brought back to China from East Africa by a Zheng He flotilla in 1414 (click to enlarge). Not the most cost-efficient zoo acquisition, but the Emperor's ships were bigger and grander than anybody else's! In the same year, on the other side of the planet, the Portuguese using a far humbler but more practical fleet took the strategic choke-point of Ceuta from the Muslims. Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, a tiny nation of fishing villages and small-time crusaders set out on a different path. Assisted by navigators and investors from other parts of Europe, the Portuguese embarked on a pay-as-you go path of conquest and trade. They focused on conquering strategic points that allowed them to control, tax, protect, and enable trade. They enforced the property rights of their allied merchants and otherwise enabled the commercial institutions by which that trade could flourish.The first little conquest was Ceuta, on the African side of the Straights of Gibraltar, the strategic choke point of the Atlantic-Mediterranean shipping routes. In 1414, at the height of the Zheng He expeditions, Prince Henry ("the Navigator") of Portugal conquered Muslim Ceuta for the Christians. Having gained this crucial strategic advantage over their Muslim and Genoan rivals, Portugal went on to conquer and settle several Atlantic island chains that had been discovered by the Genoans, including the Canaries and the Azores. The Portuguese also followed the older Genoese missions down the west coast of Africa.At each step down Africa, the Portuguese set up trading stations. They traded European goods ranging from weapons to Venetian glass beads (used by many Africans as money and jewelry) for gold, slaves, and a variety of exotic products. At the same time the Chinese Empire was persecuting its merchants, banning them from trading overseas, the Portuguese were slowly expanding their trading posts down the coast of Africa, paying for their explorations as they went by setting up new and lucrative businesses.Each expedition pushing farther south was a humble affair involving tiny numbers of small ships. Soon after the middle of the century, the Portuguese learned by repeated experience how to navigate out of sight of the (northern) Pole Star. Using this knowledge they made their way down the west coast of Africa in the southern hemisphere. Then they did what no Arab, Chinese, or Indian navigator had apparently done from the other direction. In 1488 Bartolemeu Dias' tiny fleet of caravels sailed around the southern cape of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. Four years later Portugal's neighbor Spain sent the Genoese navigator Christopher Columbus to Asia from the other direction, but Asia turned out to be much farther west than Columbus predicted and America sat in between.Extent of the Portuguese maritime empire by the mid 16th century (click to enlarge). Controlled territory in green; forts and trading colonies in red. By stark contrast, China with its vast wealth, advanced civilization, and giant fleets failed to sail around Africa to set up trading posts on the west coast of Africa or Europe.Using its now mature experience in open-seas navigation and advanced European technologies such as the cannon, as well as its good sense of affordable yet effective fighting and trading ships, subsequent Portuguese naval fleets soon conquered the main strategic choke points of Middle Eastern and Asian trade: Hormuz, Malacca, and others. Rather than ignoring merchants, they focused on controlling and enabling trade. They weren't out to show off the glory of Portugal; instead they created it. They invited investors from many other parts of Europe to send trading fleets. Trading between different Asian ports and trading European silver for exotic Asian goods both proved quite lucrative. By the early 16th century, the Portuguese had revolutionized navigation and had conquered the main trade routes of the world. Instead of Chinese fleets conquering Ceuta and Gibraltar and setting up trading posts in London and Lisbon, it was Portuguese fleets that set up trading colonies in India, Indonesia, Japan, and China. Soon other small European nations were to follow.When it comes to the "final frontier" of space, it seems to be so far the West that has stepped into China's old shoes. What did Apollo return but glory and a handful of rocks? We proved that our socialists, if funded by taxing capitalists, could beat their socialists funded by socialists. Did such proof of bureaucratic glory really require 1% of our GDP over several years?Apollo has been followed by several more white elephants that have much more to do with showing off the power and glory of federal bureaucrats than with military advantage or practical business. The space shuttle was originally promised to cost $36 million per flight (in today's dollars). It was supposed to greatly reduce the cost to space and thereby give rise to "space-based civilization." NASA predicted that we would have bases on Mars by the year 2000, and a generation of boys dreamed of growing up to be astronauts who traveled across the solar system.A billion-dollar rock made of anorthosite, a very common mineral on earth as well as on the moon. But we got there first, and our rocket was bigger than theirs! In fact the Shuttle ended up costing $1.5 billion per flight, over forty (40) times the promised price even when adjusted for inflation . The space station announced in the early 1980s and promised to be completed within a decade. But the first module was not launched (to be assembled into the greatly designed-down form of the International Space Station) until 1998. And just NASA's portion of the cost has exceeded its estimated cost for the entire program when it was first announced.Past and current proposals for Moon and Mars bases are also nothing more than the same kind of dramatic white elephants: they have no realistic prospects of military advantage or practical business. NASA is still stuck on Werner Von Braun's sixty-year-old science fiction scenario of "space stations" and "bases" that have almost no practical use beyond showing off the power of federal bureaucrats to spend vast sums of money in dramatic ways.There is a thread of space development that more closely resembles the pay-you-go methods of Portugal and other successful explorers and developers of frontiers. These involve launching useful satellites into orbit for communications and surveillance. As with the Portuguese, these serve both military and commercial purposes. They are not just for show. Spinoffs of these spacecraft form the flotilla of small unmanned spacecraft we have sent to by now explore all the planets of the solar system, as well as several comets and asteroids. The succesful Hubble telescope is a spinoff of the U.S. National Reconaissance Office's spy satellites. And environmental satellites have revolutionized weather prediction and climate study on our home planet. Recently, space tourism with suborbital rockets has demonstrated a potential to develop a new thread of pay-as-you-go space development largely unrelated to the prior gargantuan manned spaceflight efforts.The Zheng He and NASA style of frontier-as-PR, where the emphasis is on showing the glory of the government, is a recipe for failure in the exploration and development of new frontiers. It is in sharp contrast to the pay-as-you go method by which tiny Portugal conquered the world's oceans, exemplified today by the practical unmanned satellites of the commercial and military efforts. It is by these practical efforts, that fund themselves by commercial revenue or practical military or environmental benefit, and not by glorious bureaucratic white elephants, that the successful pioneers will, in good time, explore and develop the solar system.
Progress in the Malthusian isocline in England from the 13th through 19th centuries, as, among many other factors, horses slowly replaced oxen for farm work and transport, the ratio of draft animals to people increased, and more arable land was devoted to fodder relative to food.(click to enlarge)I have previously discussed Great Britain's unprecedented escape from the Malthusian trap.   Such escapes require virtuous cycles, i.e. positive feedback loops that allow productive capital to accumulate faster than it is destroyed.   There are a number of these in Britain in the era of escape from the Black Plague to the 19th century, but two of the biggest involved transportation.   One of these that I've identified was the fodder/horse/coal/lime cycle.  More and better fodder led to more and stronger horses, which hauled (among other things) coal from the mines, initially little more than quarries, that had started opening up in northeastern England by the 13th century.  Coal, like wood, was very costly to transport by land, but relatively cheap to ship by sea or navigable river.  As fodder improved, horses came to replace oxen in the expensive step transporting goods, including coal, from mine, farm, or workshop to port and from port to site of consumption.   Many other regions (e.g. in Belgium and China) had readily accessible coal, but none developed this virtuous cycle so extensively and early.Among the early uses of coal was for heating, fuel for certain industrial processes that required heat (e.g. in brewing beer), and, most interestingly, for burning lime.   Burned lime, slaked with water, could unlike the limestone it came from be easily ground into a fine powder.  This great increase in the surface area of this chemical base, which let it de-acidify the soils on which it was applied.   The soils of Britain tend to be rather acidic, which allows poisonous minerals, such as aluminum, to absorb into plants and blocks the absorption of needed nutrients (especially NPK -- nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium).   The application of lime thus increased the productivity of fields for growing both food and fodder, completing the virtuous cycle.   This cycle operated most strongly during the period of the consistent progress in the English Malthusian isocline from the 15th through 19th centuries.Another, related, but even more important cycle was the horse/transport and institutions/markets/specialization cycle.  More and better horses improved the transport of goods generally, including agricultural goods.   John Langdon [1] estimates that a team of horses could transport a wagon of goods twice as fast as a team of oxen, which suggests a factor of four increase in market area.   Add to this the Western European innovations in sailing during the 15th century (especially the trading vessels and colliers that added lateen sails(s) to the traditional square sails, allowing them to sail closer into the wind), and market regions in much of Western Europe and especially Great Britain were greatly expanded in the 15th and 16th centuries.  Expanded markets in turn allowed a great elaboration of the division of labor.  Adam Smith famously described how division of labor and specialization greatly improved the productivity of industry, but to some extent this also operated in British agriculture.   Eric Kerridge [2] eloquently described the agricultural regions of Britain, each specializing in different crops and breeds of livestock.  Some were even named after their most famous specializations: "Butter Country", "Cheese Country", "Cheshire Cheese Country", "Saltings Country", etc.  These undoubtedly emerged during the 15th through 19th centuries, as prior to that time European agriculture had been dominated by largely self-sufficient manors.   And closing the cycle, there emerged several localities that specialized in breeding a variety of horses.   Most spectacularly different British regions during this period bred no less than three kinds of large draft horses: the Shire Horse, the Suffolk Punch (in that eastern English county) and the Clydesdale (in that Scottish county). Institutions such as advertising and commercial law emerged or evolved to allow lower transaction cost dealings between strangers.   This was probably by far the most non-obvious and difficult aspect of the problem of expanding markets.   Greatly aiding in this evolution was the growth of literacy due to spread in Europe of the inexpensive books produced by printing especially in the 16th and later centuries.  Where in the Middle Ages literacy had been the privilege of a religious elite, with very few on a manor literate beyond the steward, after the 15th century an ever increasing population could read advertisements, order goods remotely, read and even draft contracts.  Another effect of longer-distance transportation was to open up more remote lands, which had been too marginal to support self-sufficient agricultural, to reclamation for use in specialized, trade-dependent agriculture.   The ability to lime soils that were otherwise too acidic also often contributed to reclamation.There were many other improvements to English agriculture and transportation during these crucial centuries, but the above cycles were probably the most important up to the 19th century.  Here I'll mention three important transportation improvements later in this period that in many ways show the culmination of the underlying trend: the development of the turnpike (private toll) roads in the 18th century and the associated development of scheduled transportation services, (2) a great expansion in the use of horse-drawn rail cars in coal and other mines, and (3) the development of river navigations largely in the 17th and 18th centuries, and canals largely in the 18th and early 19th centuries, again almost entirely through private investment and ownership.As coal mines were dug deeper, they were increasingly flooded with water.  Long before the steam engine, these mines were pumped by horse-powered gins.   Here horses on a gin power an axle (bent through a Hooke universal joint) and belt, in this case powering an 18th century farmyard innovation, the threshing machine.  The horses know to not step on the rapidly spinning axle.  I'm going to guess that the horse gin was the inspiration for the merry-go-round:Horse-drawn wagons on rails took coal from mines to docks on navigable rivers and (no small matter) pulled the empty wagons back uphill.  Coal and other ores were hauled by horses over these wagonways over distances of a few kilometers.   They were almost exclusively used for mines, quarries, clay pits, and the like, running from mine mouth to navigable water.  Here's a horse pulling coal on a wagonway:More horses pulling coal on rails:Now the only thing left of horse-drawn rail are tourist relics:Even in 1903 the London streets were still powered by horses (see if you can spot the two still-rare horseless carriages):And now for a taste of the British river navigations and canals:The Trent and Mersey canal, built in the late 18th century, could take you from one side of England to the other: Where Romans had used aqueducts to move water, the British used them in their canal system to move goods where their canals needed to span valleys.  A large number of aqueducts were built from stone in Britain during its canal boom in the 18th century.  This was the original Barton Aqueduct on the Bridgewater Canal (1760s): In the late 18th century the smelting of iron using coal instead of wood was perfected.  Soon thereafter iron became cheap enough to use for constructing bridges and aqueducts.   One result was the spectacular Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in Wales.  What in the early 19th century was a towpath for horses is now a sidewalk for tourists.   Careful, it's a long way down!ReferencesEric Kerridge, The Farmers of Old EnglandJohn Langdon, Horses, Oxen, and Technological Innovation
This is from a very old Usenet post of mine:I can only mention [in reply to a previous post] my Law of the Dominant Paradigm:Given opposing opinions with equal evidence in their favor, the less popular opinion is more likely to be correct. To see why this is so, consider how evidence -- facts, data, observations, etc. are obtained and transmitted by human culture. Each observer and transmitter passes on a filtered version of the evidence, either consiously or unconsiously, to fit a particular paradigm. If most of the information gatherers in a society -- journalists, academicians, writers, movie studios, etc. -- subscribe to one out of several possible opinions, it is natural to expect that more evidence will be gathered that supports that opinion than the others, even if the some of the other opinions have equal validity. This does not mean that evidence is useless; it means that evidence is a function both of the reality and the paradigms held by the information gatherers. Evidence given in an argument must be adjusted by the resources devoted to gathering evidence in favor of each opinion. The amount of bias caused by the dominant paradigm effect is not well-defined, but an extremely new or unpopular opinion is likely to have little evidence in its favor, since little has been done to gather such evidence.On the net, it is very easy to fall into the mindset of simply agreeing with and copying those already dominant on the net. Far more fruitful are original ideas, disagreements, and working to find evidence for unpopular and new opinions to determine their worth.
Larry White reports on President Bush's nomination of Randy Kroszner for the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.  I'm so used to Bush doing such destructive things to our institutions that I'm doubly amazed and delighted by this choice.If Alan Greenspan, who once strongly favored the gold standard, didn't turn the dollar into a gold currency as head of the Federal Reserve (at least, it didn't stay that way in recent years), I suppose we can't expect a partial fan of free banking to return the U.S. to private competition in money just by being on the Board.  But it would be nice to know that somebody who shares Greenspan's knowledge that fiat legal tender is not the only useful kind of money is going to be on the Board.  Perhaps Kroszner can unconfuse  federal law enforcers about private currencies.
My article A Measure of Sacrifice explains why(1) the kind of contract that dominates most of our lives (i.e., employment) is usually measured by effort rather than output, and(2) why the clock and the sandglass, involving two almost completely different craft traditions, were invented at the same time and place in history.
The subjective theory of value, used by the Salamanca school in Renaissance Spain and most recently in neoclassical and Austrian economics,  is undoubtedly the correct one,  despite the fact that figures ranging from Smith to Ricardo to Marx used labor as a fundamental measure of value.  This labor theory of value is profoundly wrong.  If I spend hours digging a hole in your back yard, that doesn't provide you any value unless you wanted a hole in your back yard.   Nevertheless, as we shall see, using labor, or more generally cost, as a measure of value is a common strategy of our institutions and in itself often quite valuable thing to do.   How does this come about?   The key to the puzzle is Yoram Barzel's idea of a proxy measure, which I have described as follows:The process of determining the value of a product from observations is necessarily incomplete and costly. For example, a shopper can see that an apple is shiny red. This has some correlation to its tastiness (the quality a typical shopper actually wants from an apple), but it's hardly perfect. The apple's appearance is not a complete indicator -- an apple sometimes has a rotten spot down inside even if the surface is perfectly shiny and red.  We call an indirect measure of value -- for example the shininess, redness, or weight of the apple -- a proxy measure. In fact, all measures of value, besides prices in an ideal market, are proxy measures -- real value is subjective and largely tacit.   Such observations also come at a cost. It may take some time to sort through apples to find the shiniest and reddest ones, and meanwhile the shopper bruises the other apples. It costs the vendor to put on a fake shiny gloss of wax, and it costs the shopper because he may be fooled by the wax, and because he has to eat wax with his apple. Sometimes these measurement costs comes about just from the imperfection of honest communication. In other cases, such as waxing the apple, the cost occurs because rationally self-interested parties play games with the observable...Cost can usually be measured far more objectively than value. As a result, the most common proxy measures are various kinds of costs. Examples include: (a) paying for employment in terms of time worked, rather than by quantity produced (piece rates) or other possible measures. Time measures sacrifice, i.e. the cost of opportunities foregone by the employee.(b) most numbers recorded and reported by accountants for assets are costs rather than market prices expected to be recovered by the sale of assets. (c) non-fiat money and collectibles obtain their value primarily from their scarcity, i.e. their cost of replacement. (From "Measuring Value").The proxy measure that dominates most of our lives is the time wage:To create anything of value requires some sacrifice. To successfully contract we must measure value. Since we can’t, absent a perfect exchange market, directly measure the economic value of something, we may be able to estimate it indirectly by measuring something else. This something else anchors the performance – it gives the performer an incentive to optimize the measured value. Which measures are the most appropriate anchors of performance? Starting in Europe by the 13th century, that measure was increasingly a measure of the sacrifice needed to create the desired economic value. This is hardly automatic – labor is not value. A bad artist can spend years doodling, or a worker can dig a hole where nobody wants a hole. Arbitrary amounts of time could be spent on activities that do not have value for anybody except, perhaps, the worker himself. To improve the productivity of the time rate contract required two breakthroughs: the first, creating the conditions under which sacrifice is a better estimate of value than piece rate or other measurement alternatives, and second, the ability to measure, with accuracy and integrity, the sacrifice.Piece rates measure directly some attribute of a good or service that is important to its value – its quantity, weight, volume, or the like -- and then fix a price for it. Guild regulations which fixed prices often amounted to creating piece rates. Piece rates seem the ideal alternative for liberating workers, but they suffer for two reasons. First, the outputs of labor depend not only on effort, skills, etc. (things under control of the employee), but things out of control of the employee.  The employee wants something like insurance against these vagaries of the work environment. The employer, who has more wealth and knowledge of market conditions, takes on these risks in exchange for profit.In an unregulated commodity market, buyers can reject or negotiate downwards the price of poor quality goods. Sellers can negotiate upwards or decline to sell. With piece rate contracts, on the other hand, there is a fixed payment for a unit of output. Thus second main drawback to piece rates is that they motivate the worker to put out more quantity at the expense of quality. This can be devastating. The tendency of communist countries to pay piece rates, rather than hourly rates, is one reason that, while the Soviet bloc’s quantity (and thus the most straightforward measurements of economic growth) was able to keep up with the West, quality did not (thus the contrast, for example, between the notoriously ugly and unreliable Trabant of East Germany and the BMWs, Mercedes, Audi and Volkswagens of West Germany).Thus with the time-rate wage the employee is insured against vagaries of production beyond his control, including selling price fluctuations (in the case of a market exchange), or variation in the price or availability of factors of production (in the case of both market exchange or piece rates). The employer takes on these risks, while at the same time through promotion, raises, demotions, wage cuts or firing retaining incentives for quality employee output. Besides lacking implicit insurance for the employee, another limit to market purchase of each worker’s output is that it can be made prohibitively costly by relationship-specific investments. These investments occur when workers engage in interdependent production -- as the workers learn the equipment or adapt to each other. Relationship-specific investments can also occur between firms, for example building a cannon foundry next to an iron mine. These investments, when combine with the inability to write long-term contracts that account for all eventualities, motivate firms to integrate. Dealing with unspecified eventualities then becomes the right of the single owner. This incentive to integrate is opposed by the diseconomies of scale in a bureaucracy, caused by the distribution of knowledge, which market exchange handles much better.  These economic tradeoffs produce observed distributions of firm sizes in a market, i.e. the number of workers involved in an employment relationship instead of selling their wares directly on a market.The main alternative to market exchange of output, piece rate, or coerced labor (serfdom or slavery) consists of the employers paying by sacrifice -- by some measure of the desirable things the employee forgoes to pursue the employer’s objectives. An hour spent at work is an hour not spent partying, playing with the children, etc. For labor, this “opportunity cost” is most easily denominated in time – a day spent working for the employer is a day not spent doing things the employee would, if not for the pay, desire to do. Time doesn’t specify costs such as effort and danger. These have to be taken into account by an employee or his union when evaluating a job offer. Worker choice, through the ability to switch jobs at much lower costs than with serfdom, allows this crucial quality control to occur.It’s usually hard to specify customer preferences, or quality, in a production contract. It’s easy to specify sacrifice, if we can measure it. Time is immediately observed; quality is eventually observed. With employment via a time-wage, the costly giving up of other opportunities, measured in time, can be directly motivated (via daily or hourly wages), while quality is motivated in a delayed, discontinuous manner (by firing if employers and/or peers judge that quality of the work is too often bad). Third parties, say the guy who owned the shop across the street, could observe the workers arriving and leaving, and tell when they did so by the time. Common synchronization greatly reduced the opportunities for fraud involving that most basic contractual promise, the promise of time. Once pay for time is in place, the basic incentives are in place – the employee is, verifiably, on the job for a specific portion of the day – so he might as well work. He might as well do the work, both quantity and quality, that the employer requires. With incentives more closely aligned by the calendar and the city bells measuring the opportunity costs of employment, to be compensated by the employer, the employer can focus observations on verifying the specific quantity and qualities desired, and the employee (to gain raises and avoid getting fired) focuses on satisfying them. So with the time-wage contract, perfected by northern and western Europeans in the late Middle Ages, we have two levels of the protocol in this relationship: (1) the employee trades away other opportunities to commit his time to the employer – this time is measured and compensated, (2) the employee is motivated, by (positively) opportunities for promotions and wage rate hikes and (negatively) by the threat of firing, to use that time, otherwise worthless to both employer and employee, to achieve the quantity and/or quality goals desired by the employer.(from From "A Measure of Sacrifice")Proxy measures also explain how money can depend on standards of nature instead of a singular trusted third party:Although anatomically modern humans surely had conscious thought, language, and some ability to plan, it would have required little conscious thought or language, and very little planning, to generate trades. It was not necessary that tribe members reasoned out the benefits of anything but a single trade. To create this institution it would have sufficed that people follow their instincts to make obtain collectibles with the characteristics outlined below. (as indicated by proxy observations that make approximate estimations for these characteristics).Utilitarian jewelry: silver shekels from Sumeria.  The recipient of a payment would weigh the segment of coil used as payment and could cut it at an arbitrary spot to test its purity.   A wide variety of other cultures, from the Hebrews and the famously commercial Phoenicians to the ancient Celtic and Germanic tribes, used such forms of precious metal money long before coinage.At first, the production of a commodity simply because it is costly seems quite wasteful. However, the unforgeably costly commodity repeatedly adds value by enabling beneficial wealth transfers. More of the cost is recouped every time a transaction is made possible or made less expensive.  The cost, initially a complete waste, is amortized over many transactions.  The monetary value of precious metals is based on this principle. It also applies to collectibles, which are more prized the rarer they are and the less forgeable this rarity is. It also applies where provably skilled or unique human labor is added to the product, as with art. (from "Shelling Out: The Origins of Money")The rational price of such a monetary commodity will be, ignoring more minor effects (e.g. the destruction of monetary units) the lesser of:(1) the value a monetary unit is expected to add to future transactions, i.e. what it will save in transaction costs(2) the cost of creating a new monetary unitSince (1) cannot be objectively measured, but at best can only be intuitively estimated, as long as one is confident that (1)>(2) the cost of creating a monetary unit becomes a good proxy measure of the value of the monetary unit.  If monetary units are not fungible, but their costs are comparable, their relative value can be well approximated by their relative costs even if (2)>=(1).   If the expected value of a monetary unit drops below the replacement cost, gold miners (for example) stop creating new monetary units (in the case of gold miners, if their production costs exceed this expected value they stop mining gold), holding the money supply steady which minimizes inflation.  If it goes above replacement costs more gold mines can be affordably worked, increasing the money supply as the economy grows without inflation.  This all depends on having a secure floor to replacement costs, which is well approximated by gold and silver but violated by fiat currencies (as can be seen by for example comparing the rampant inflations of many 20th century fiat currencies against the quite mild, by comparison, inflations that followed discoveries such as Potosi silver in the 16th century and California gold in the 19th).Sumerian shell money.We often adapt institutions from prior similar institutions, and often by accident.  So, for example, money can evolve from utilitarian commodities that have the best characteristics of money (securely storable, etc.) in a particular environment (e.g. cigarettes in a prison).  But humans also have foresight and can reason by analogy, and so can design an exchange to trade new kinds of securities, a new kind of insurance service, or a new kind of currency.  Naturally such designs are still subject to a large degree of trial and error, of the creative destruction of the market.   And they are subject to network externalities: to, roughly speaking, Metcalfe's law, which states the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its members, and that a network of one is useless.    A telephone is useless unless somebody else you want to talk to also has a telephone.  Likewise, currency is useless unless one has somebody to buy from or sell to who will take or give that currency.   Indeed, with money the situation is even worse than most networks, because unless that person wants to do a corresponding sell or buy back to you at a later date, the money will get "stuck."  It will have zero velocity.  One needs either specific cycles to keep money circulating (as with the ancient kula ring), or a second currency with such cycles that can be exchanged for the first.  Thus, the marketing problem of starting a new currency is formidable.   Although Paypal was implementing just a payment system in dollars, not a new currency, it hit on a great strategy of general applicability: target specific communities of people that trade with each other (in Paypal's case, the popular eBay auction site).But insisting that gold, silver, shells, online payment systems or currencies, etc. must be useful for some other purpose, such as decoration, before they can be used as money, is a terrible confusion, akin to insisting that an insurance service must start out as useful for something else, perhaps for stabling horses, before one can write the insurance contracts.   Indeed many of us value precious metals and shells for decoration more for a reverse reason, which I explain in the above-linked essay on the origins of money.ConclusionThe labor theory of value is wrong.   Value is fundamentally a matter of subjective preferences.  Nevertheless. Yoram Barzel's crucial idea of proxy measures allows us to understand why measures of labor and more generally measures of cost are so often and so usefully applied as measures of value in institutions, including wage contracts and non-fiat money.
There are some fascinating projects out there to build 3D printers that can manufacture a substantial amount of their own parts -- they are partially self-replicating.  Self-replication in itself is largely of theoretical interest, as the reproduction process is very slow and labor intensive.  Worse, the resulting machines can build devices only at the lowest common denominator of materials that can be easily 3D printed at room temperature.  For any given kind of part, such general-purpose machines will be easily beaten in both production rate and quality of parts made by specialized machines.  Nevertheless, I find these devices quite interesting from a theoretical point of view.  The complexity of design needed to make these machines fully self-replicating may give us some idea of how improbable it was for self-replicating life to originate.In a hypothetical scenario where one lacked ready access to industrial civilization -- after a nuclear war or in a future space industry, for example -- machines like these could be quite useful for bootstrapping industry with a bare minimum of capital equipment.  For similar reasons, it's possible that machines like these might prove useful in some developing world areas -- and indeed that seems to be a big goal of these projects.  Add in open source code made in the first world but freely available in the third, and this opens up the intriguing possibility of a large catalog of parts that can be freely downloaded and cheaply printed.  Also useful for this goal is to reduce the cost of the remaining parts not replicated by the machine -- although even, for example, $100 worth of parts is more than a year's income for many people in the developing world, and the polymer materials that can be most usefully printed are also rather expensive.  But ya gotta start somewhere.RepRap is a project to build a 3D printer that can manufacture all of its expensive parts. Although they call this "self-replicating", it might be better to think of their goal as an open-source digital smithy using plastics instead of iron. To achieve their goal the machine need not produce "widely-available [and inexpensive] bought-in parts (screws, washers, microelectronic chips, and the odd electric motor)." That's quite a shortcut as such parts, despite being cheap in first world terms, require a very widespread and complex infrastructure to manufacture and are rather costly by developing country standards.  The machine also does not attempt to assemble itself -- extensive manual assembly is presumed. RepRap makes a practical intermediate goal between today's 3D printers and more complete forms of self-replication that would, for example, include all parts of substantial weight, would self-assemble, or both. The project is associated with some silly economics, but I'm hardly complaining as long as the bad ideas result in such good projects.  So far RepRap has succeeded in producing "a complete set of parts for the screw section of the extruder."Similar to RepRap, but apparently not quite as far along, is  Tommelise.   Their goal is that a craftsman can build a new Tommelise using an old Tommelise and $100-$150 in parts plus the cost of some extra tools.A less ambitious project that already works -- an open source fab, but with no goal of making its own parts -- is the Fab@Home project. Using Fab@Home folks have already printed out stuff in silicone, cake icing, chocolate, and more.Meanwhile, in an economically attractive (but not self-replicating) application these guys want to print out bespoke bones based on CT or MRI scans.
The basic idea of bit gold is for "bit gold miners" to set their computers to solving computationally intensive mathematical puzzles, then to publish the solutions to these puzzles in secure public registries, giving them unique title to these provably scarce and securely timestamped bits.   These titles to timestamped bits will be more secure and provably scarce than precious metals, collectibles, and any other objects that have ever been used as money. In a description of bit gold, which was mostly an overview of the technology, I wrote about how, because the algorithms and architectures for solving computationally intensive mathematical puzzles to create bit gold will often be dramatically improved, the bits (the puzzle solutions) from one period (anywhere from seconds to weeks, let's say a week) to the next are not fungible.  But fungible units can be created from non-fungible ones:bit gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today [pooling commodities with a wide variety of qualities into a handful of standard grades] to make commodity markets possible.Bit strings (puzzle problem/solution pairs) are securely timestamped by their time of publication. More recent solutions that have been produced in greater quantities will be discounted by markets. To create fungible units dealers will bundle strings of different value into pools of a standard value (i.e. collect strings into a pool so that the sum of the market values of the strings in the pool add up to the standard value).It's a bit indirect, but computers can easily handle these logistics. Leaving aside the gold metaphor for a minute, one can think of these bit strings as digital rare postage stamps. Each stamp might trade for a different price, but one can sort stamps into pools so that the prices of stamps in each pool add up to the same total price. Then divide each pool into tranches to create your standard currency denominations.The rare stamp metaphor is, however, in other ways very misleading.  Unlike stamps, but like gold, there are no ongoing changes in subjective valuations between bit strings to worry about, but instead the demand for bit gold is purely for its monetary functions, and thus purely based on how scarce the supply of puzzles solved during a given time period was and is.  As a result, pooling and tranching will work far better for bit gold than it does for actual rare postage stamps.This deserves more elaboration.  It seems to be a common objection to bit gold that the mere difference in the price of a bit from one time period to the next produced by technology improvements introduce intractible subjective valuations, making the matter of comparing one week to the next subject to too much uncertainty and transaction costs, as occurs with many collectibles.  Just as pooling and tranching rare postage stamps would be a somewhat risky affair as subjective valuations of the underlying stamps change, so too this is supposed for bit gold.The problem that would occur if we tried to turn most collectibles into a standard currency by pooling and tranching is that, besides a subjective aesthetic component in the demand curve that doesn't come into play with computer bits, their scarcity is uncertain.  Art can turn out to be forged, rare stamps thought to be lost or to have never existed might be found, and so on.  The supply curve, in other words, can be highly uncertain and in danger of elasticity.  Since the supply and demand curves of different pools can change differently over time, the relative values of pools would diverge from their initial values, so that trying to use tranches as standard denominations of a currency would create arbitrage opportunities.By sharp contrast bit gold will be entirely public: no one gains secure title to any puzzle solutions until they are published.  Thus, the exact amount and kind of puzzle solutions during a given period are well known, and perfectly define the supply curve relative to future weeks for all time thereafter.There will be, in other words, a perfectly objective, measurable, and inelastic supply curve, completely derivable from the relative scarcity of bits (puzzle solutions) on the week (or the day, or the hour, or the minute, if necessary) of their publication. Arbitrage to set the different prices of different weeks (or minutes) can be computerized on this basis. The demand curve, the demand for puzzle solutions for the monetary functions they can perform as a store of value and medium of exchange, will be based on recognition of the superiority of bit gold as a form of money that is more secure and has a far less elastic supply curve than traditional commodities such as precious metals.  Since there are no aesthetic differences, the demand curve will be the same function of scarcity for all weeks (or minutes), so it won't affect the simple scheme of automated arbitrage between epochs with different supply curves.   The supply and demand curves of different pools will change in the same way over time, and the relative values of pools will not diverge from their initial relative values.  Using tranches as standard denominations for a currency does not create arbitrage opportunities.For most of history collectibles were used for as stores of value and media of exchange; aesthetics played an important role.  But before we can separate out the roles of scarcity and aesthetics, we must ask why humans evolved such aesthetic values.  The aesthetic instincts, for example the instinct to collect shiny things, evolved just because in the evolutionary environment they approximated an instinct to collect scarce things, and to distinguish hard-to-find from easy-to-find things, i.e. an instinct to recognize and collect objects that can best perform monetary functions, as I describe here, in the "Evolution..." section early in the paper, and the "Attributes of Collectibles" section late in the paper.As a proximate matter, the contribution to the demand curve from demand for monetary functions (store of value or medium of exchange or both) and the contribution from aesthetic considerations are completely separable.   One can demand a commodity for its aesthetic value, or for its value as money, or for both, or for neither.  Thus a check for a million dollars might have a design that is utterly philistine, yet the check is still worth a million dollars.The value of gold today is almost entirely based on its monetary value rather than mere aesthetic value. There are plenty of metals that are as shiny and smooth as gold, but people don't demand them as a store of value or medium of exchange because they are common. There are plenty of rocks that look as good as diamonds, but "diamonds are a girl's best friend" because they are hard to obtain and thus hold their value.   Value comes to attach to the unique aesthetic features of gold or diamonds because these features signal scarcity.   The value of precious metals or gems as stores of value, media of exchange, or even as cultural icons does not come from these aesthetic features, it is only signalled by them.  It is their secure scarcity, not their aesthetic features, that allows them to be more securely used as a store of value and thus gives them a monetary value, and often a corresponding emotional and cultural value, far above the often trivial value they would have if they had the same aesthetics but were common.There will be a problem defining futures contracts for yet-to-be produced bit gold: how much it might cost to solve a given puzzle a year later, or even a month, will be a very uncertain matter. But the pools that define currencies will be based on spot prices for already produced bit gold, not on futures.[These comments edit and add to comments of mine under previous blog post(s)]
A recent discussion has inspired me to articulate my own design for better government, long simmering in the back of my head and in various scribbles. My focus is on the "action end" of government where disputes are resolved and laws enforced, namely what in modern democratic systems we call the judicial and executive branches. Indeed except for the Articles of Incorporation, which is the constitution of Juristopia, its laws evolve mostly by the common law method of precedent. Subsidiary organizations are free to pass bylaws if they wish, as long as they do not contravene Juristopia's own Articles of Incorporation or disobey an Order of the Extraordinary Court. There is very narrow legislative role for the Board of Franchisors which will be stated below. The main democratic element is juries, which play an important role in limiting the exercise of governmental powers.To simplify discussions of political power and rebellion, let's posit a system of magic Rings of Power, a la Tolkien. However, there is no master One Ring. (Tolkien surely had the correct answer for such a totalitarian power: it must be destroyed at all costs). Instead these are Rings of Discontempt that operate as follows:(1) There are N Rings, where N is odd, say 9. Any Ring in the possession of an individual who possesses another Ring has no power (that includes the first Ring possessed -- the second renders the first impotent -- so that there is a strong disincentive to accumulate Rings).(2) To operate the ring, a quorum of holders of the Rings, called the Court of Extraordinary Justices, touch their Rings together and prouounce the unique name of an individual to be punished for Contempt of Court, and pronounce a punishment.(3) The quorum of joined Rings can administer the following magical punishments to the named person at any range: (a) imprisonment in a magical jail for any specified number of time, requiring the aid of no human jailers (b) instant and painless death(4) The Rings confer on their wearers complete invulnerability to any kind of violence.There is no other magic of any sort in Juristopia.Like the Catholic College of Cardinals, the Extraordinary Justices choose their own successors. Board of Franchsisor members also choose their own successors, but have no Rings. Combined with the magical Rings, self-succession allows the Extraordinary Court to avoid the two main sources of political bias and pressure from other branches of government they now face: from their initial appointments by other branches, and by the ultimate ability of an executive branch to ignore a court order that it despises. An executive officer who refuses to execute a Court order is punished with Contempt of Court; the Rings insure that no rebellion against such punishment is possible.The Articles of Incorporation state that the Court of Extraordinary Justices exercises only a very narrow jurisdiction, called the Extraordinary Jurisdiction. All Ordinary Jurisdiction, and all armed forces and police powers besides the Rings, are auctioned off to the highest bidder as franchises. Franchises are property rights to exercise certain narrowly defined governmental powers, subject to limitations on the monopolistic fees or taxes they may charge, determined by juries selected by lottery from the feepayers or taxpayers.A number of general kinds of franchises are specified by the Articles: public nuisance suppression, fraud suppression, armed forces, police forces, and common law courts are the five main categories of franchises, but there is a vast variety of possible jurisdictional "boundaries" for franchises within each category, and ownership of franchises may be bundled within or across boundaries in a dizzying variety of ways. The franchise market can thus assemble bundles that best persuade juries of feepayers to maximize fees. Each franchise collects its own monopoly fees from all persons within its territory; no franchise may charge fees that are more than what a jury considers "reasonable", including a reasonable profit. The general franchises stated in the Articles can be subdivided and narrowed, but not expanded, by the Board of Franchisors, which can pass bylaws that specify the subject matter and personal jurisdiction and territorial boundaries of each franchise. Some franchises are executive (similar to government agencies), and some are judicial (courts). The Board, like the Court, selects its own successors.The Articles of Incorporation state that Juristopia Corporation itself does not have shareholders and may not earn a profit. Its only officers are members of the Board and Court, and the salaries of these are limited to salaries deemed "reasonable" by juries chosen by lottery from among Juristopia' taxpayers, as are its overall budget and the fees (taxes) it may charge within the territory of Juristopia. Its officers and employees may legally only engage in the business of Extraordinary Jurisdiction (Court) and writing initial franchise deeds (Board) -- they are are forbidden from engaging in ordinary business or Ordinary Jurisdiction.All Justices and Board members must be eunuchs (if male) or artificially or naturally postmenstrual and sterile (if female), may own no amount or kind of property that a jury deems "unreasonable", must dispose of any properties that will create an imminent conflict of interest, and must recuse themselves from any legislation or cases that create a conflict of interest. They may not reproduce themselves in any fashion. The purpose of all this is to minimize potential biases, conflicts of interests, and motivations to use the Rings to expand power. (A digital protocol would be ideal if human judgment were not required to render verdicts and define new franchises).The Articles state that all the jurisdictions and armed powers shall be auctioned off to the highest bidder as franchises. There would, for example, be Army, Navy, and Air Forces franchises empowered to charge a reasonable fee to the entire island for their services. There would be some public nuisance suppression franchises: for example there could be an air pollution franchise, allowing the franchise owner to regulate all pollution in Juristopia, similar to the U.S. EPA today. These franchises might be further unbundled into the particulates franchise, the sulfur dioxide franchise, the carbon dioxide franchise, etc. -- or alternatively the car tailpipe franchise, the electric plant emissions franchise, etc. These franchises would be allowed to auction off tradeable emission rights, or altenatively to charge emission fees. To the extent franchises are monopolies, or coercive, or both, the fees they can charge are limited to what are "reasonable" fees as determined by juries.The Articles restrict the Extraordinary Court's jurisdiction to appeals in certain narrow (extraordinary) areas: choice of law and forum clauses, cases involving the property rights of franchises, and cases involving violations of a Bill of Rights, which would also be part of of the Articles. The Bill of Rights states a number of individual procedural rights, such as right to trial by juries, the right of juries chosen by a lottery of taxpayers to decide whether any taxes or franchise fees are reasonable, limits on search, seizure, and arrest, and so on that must be respected by any entity exercising a judicial or police power.All Ordinary Jurisdictions are auctioned off to the highest bidder and can be freely traded. Among the Articles of Incorporation would be a strong requirement that Choice of Forum and Choice of Law clauses in contracts be enforced in a way much broader than current U.S. practice (e.g. allowing all torts of any kind between the two parties to be included in the scope of choice, overriding any franchise jurisdictions).In the expanded form I propose, these will allow pairs of persons (individual or corporate) to opt out of the franchise that would otherwise have jurisdiction over future cases between them. This introduces a substantial degree of competition between franchises, and one might be able to assemble an AC-style system of insurance/protection companies from such clauses.Under the Articles there are no Chief Justices, Presidents, or other lead executive officers that have special constitutional powers. Any Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces is optional and would be chosen by the various armed frachises themselves, as they may agree. The Court and Board are free to elect nominal leaders for administrative purposes if they wish.The biggest open problem in Juristopia is how to stop the Extraordinary Court from cleverly interpreting the Articles of Incorporation to usurp the Ordinary Jurisdictions that properly belong to the franchises. Or from just using its control of the Rings to blatantly violate the Articles and enforce martial law and slavery for its own grand benefit and everbody else's pauperization, once enough people have settled on the island with high exit costs. A possible solution might include giving Extraordinary Juries, selected by lottery for each decision, their own set of Contempt of Jury Rings to enforce jury restrictions on the Court and Board.javascript:void(0)Publish PostI have also neglected powers to make and enforce treaties with other governments. Since such treaties typical assume external sovereignty, the very low degree of internal sovereignty in Juristopia, which is otherwise a very good feature, may pose an interesting problem for treaties.(N.B.: I crudely described a previous version of Juristopia here).UPDATE: spelling change.
Research In Motion, Ltd. of Canada, the maker of the BlackBerry, has settled with NTP over its patent lawsuit for $612.5 million. Hopefully unlike the previous settlement this one will stick so that Americans can use our BlackBerries clear of these clouds.There were many interesting issues in this case, including cross-border infringement. Two other interesting parts of this case were the court's refusal to order an injunction and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)'s re-examination of NTP's patents. Any settlement would almost surely have been far higher if the injunction had gone through and if the PTO had not started rejecting NTP's patent claims. The importance of the "CrackBerry" to a wide variety of business and government operations could have worked greatly in NTP's favor, since the cost of shutting down BlackBerries in the United States could have cost RIM billions, but it also helped convince many politicians, who pressured the USPTO and perhaps the judge, that there was no way to shut down the network without disrupting some emergency services in the U.S.It will be interesting if we learn to what extent RIM's stated ability to quickly replace its software to avoid NTP's patents, in the event that the court did order a shutdown of the United States part of the network, was reality or a bluff. This was again a double-edged argument as on the one hand RIM hoped to convince NTP an injunction would not cost it billions, but on the other hand it might have convinced the judge that a shutdown would not cause the feared disruptions.The strategic landscape regarding this settlement was as a result of all these factors, and more, quite interesting. As I am fascinated by civil procedure and settlement strategy, I will probably be posting more about the strategy in this case in the near future.
Symbols are indispensible, but we lost something when symbolic algebra replaced geometry as the main medium of mathematics. My math is quite rusty but I understood these proofs within a few seconds. Via Teeming Multitudes.
The Chinese invented printing, but their writing system required a large number of typefaces, which made for very high up-front capital costs to print even a single short book.  Centuries after the slow dawn of Chinese printing Gutenberg in Germany, taking advantage of a concise phonetic alphabet, requiring only a small number of typefaces, invented a printing method that required much less up-front capital than Chinese printers.  The Internet has even more radically lowered up-front capital costs to publish than did the Gutenberg revolution.Chinese printed works were vast but rare. European books were smaller but still too long. Internet works are the actual length a reader needs, they are (or soon will be) available practically everywhere, and often readers can interact frequently with the author.Most readers don't want to spend most of their time reading verbose works by single author, when a greater variety of more relevant and thoughtfully concise works are available from a much larger pool of thinkers. Prior to the Internet they had much less choice: books were just the way educated people learned and taught.  (And many people still believe that reading and writing books is the sine quo non of being educated, just as many Europeans in 1500 still lauded the superiority of scribal methods and scholastic thought).Magazines and newspapers involve smaller form factors, but they still draw from a very small pool of authors.  These authors can only write in detail about a wider variety of subjects by pretending to know things that they don't: they take human institutions far more complicated than a single human can possibly comprehend and boil them down to a series of hypersimplified theories, what in less authoritative contexts we'd call ideologies or conspiracy theories.Instead of being forced to read a vast number of words each from a small number and variety of authors, already widely read by many other people (making your reading of them often quite intellectually redundant), on the Internet you can read much less per-author text (and thus, potentially at least, far more thought out per word) from a much greater number and variety of authors.The Internet also can be more interactive with more select groups than the old face-to-face + snail-mail + books regime— providing much more opportunity for Socratic dialog, glossing, and other intellectual processes that were too often neglected after Gutenberg.  And while the Internet can produce far higher amounts of garbage,  mixing up thoughtlessly popular haystacks with thoughtfully rare needles, search engines and links often make wading through these vasty spaces much easier.  The Internet allows you to meet people who share your specialized interests and dialog with them, making possible specific interactions that rarely happened in the old regime.  However, without actually reading the content, i.e. while initially searching for it, it is hard to distinguish thoughtless (even though textual) content from the thoughtful content -- a big reason why at least for the moment book-literacy retains its aura of intellectual superiority over Internet literacy: scholarly publishers with their monetary incentives often take the time to select the most thoughtful works for our consideration.  Nevertheless, they lack the knowledge needed to select the most relevant works to match the wide variety of interests and knowledge of their readers, or to judge well among works outside their specialties.Much as more efficient and speedier transportation networks enabled labor and natural resources to be brought together in a much greater variety of ways, so does the Internet by providing more direct and speedy connections between minds enable a far greater division of knowledge than was possible with in the face-to-face+snail-mail+books regime. However, in contrast to the economy of things, that division of knowledge is largely (so far, at least, and still mostly for the foreseeable future) unmonetized: the information economy is a vastly different beast than the economy of things.That said, there is a good book(!) that covers much of this (along with of course a bunch of introductory material redundant for most readers, as well as the typical trivial or thoughtless text added to pad it out to books size):  Smarter Than You Think by Clive Thompson.tl;dr if you thought this blog post was too long, why would you ever pick up a book? 
The public interest (or public use) doctrine has been widely used in U.S. law in areas ranging from constitutional law (including the Takings Clause, substantive due process, and the First Amendment) to bankruptcy law and the regulation of public utilities, telecommunications, and transportation businesses  in particular as well as of business generally.   But this doctrine has been radically changed in form over the years, until today it is a only a mockery of its original form.From its origins in the medieval doctrines of seisin and feudal service, as applied to private rights to exercise police powers or to charge taxes or tolls, it was extended to apply to franchises and monopolies in general. During the New Deal, the idea was preposterously expanded to justify even the arbitrary and discriminatory regulation of every kind of property.In medieval times governmental jurisdiction was property. Like other property, it was either derived by title ultimately from the king or by long use (prescription). Like other property, it was governed by the doctrine of seisin, or active and notorious possession. Often property , including land, entailed, as a matter of obligation specified in charter (the deed under which property was conditionally transferred) or as a matter of custom, obligations such as military service, rent, or maintaining or using the property. In the context of a franchise involving police powers, the doctrine of "non-user," justified as either seisin or implied feudal obligation, often imposed certain procedural obligations -- for example to exercise the police power against lawbreakers and to respect the right of trial by jury. The non-user doctrine was, however, controversial, and owners of these intangible properties argued that their franchises, even franchises to collect taxes and tolls or exercise police powers, were purely private property for their private use.In 1237 King Henry II argued, in a letter to the Abbott of Peterborough, that his grant to the abbott of local police powers was conditional on their being exercised:Since we ordered all the bailiffs in our realm to see that watches were kept by night against the disturbers of our peace and commanded that the holders of liberties [i.e. franchises] should see that this was observed in their liberties, we marvel greatly that you in your liberty of Peterborough have allowed homicide and theft to be committed, and have taken no steps to keep our peace...We enjoin you therefore that, as you wish to retain your liberty, you take care to deal with malefactors and peace breakers, so that it may appear that you are a lover of peace, and that we may not have to lay our hands upon your liberty because you have failed.A more recent case that illustrated this debate is Att.-Gen. v. Newdegate (King's Bench 1519). This case was to determine whether the franchises of "infangthief" and "outfangthief" that had been deeded by the king to Newdegate for his manor was forfeit back to the king due to "non-user." "Infangthief" was the right to hang those who had committed a theft on the land and caught red-handed on the land, and "outfangthief" was the right to hang such a thief even if caught red-handed elsewhere.According to a report of the case, "the king's attorney showed that [Newdegate] had not used it, and had also misused it, for he did not have gallows..." Newdegate's attorney lamely explained that "his gallows were blown down in the wind," but over a year had gone by and they were still down. He argued that whatever the reason the gallows were blown down was irrelevant because "non-user is neither a forfeiture nor finable because this is a liberty [franchise] granted to him which he may use as he wishes, and it is for his own advantage." Another words, he was arguing -- and it was a plausible argument at the time -- that even a function we now consider a core governmental function was purely a matter of private property. Even a police force and a court did not in this view entail enough public interest to justify common law regulation.However, Chief Justice Fyneux held that "this leet [i.e. the private court] is granted for the common wealth as well as for the benefit of the party [owner], and it must be used or else it is forfeit." Whereas in previous centuries this kind of forfeiture proceeding, called a quo warranto, was considered merely a dispute over title to the franchise as either the king's private property or the current operator's private property, now the franchise of monopoly police power over an area was considered to have a pubic interest. It was this public interest, not an implied feudal obligation to the king as grantor of the franchiise, that now justified common law obligations and restrictions on the use of a police powers franchise.In the late 17th century, Lord Chief Justice Hale, in his treatise De Portibus Maris (Concerning the Gates to the Sea) applied this doctrine to franchises to take taxes or tolls. All rights to charge taxes or tolls were originally the property of the king (the king's prerogative), but like the king's jurisdiction it was often granted or owned by prescription by other parties in the form of a franchise. Hale discussed the issue of what kind of commercial enterprise constituted taking a "toll," and thus required an intangible property right -- a franchise -- on top of the personal and real property of the enterprise in order to legally operate the enterprise. If the price was a toll, the enterprise was performed under franchise with a public interest, and thus would be regulated by the common-law franchise doctrines of non-user (the requirement of continual use for the public) and that the rate charged be reasonable.Besides toll-roads and bridges, for Hale toll-taking included being the sole operator of a port facility such as a wharf or a set of cranes, or the operator of the sole ferry in an area. Hale justified this scope of public interest by citing the Roman idea of juris publica, under which the emperor, rather than local authorities or private parties (juris privati) had jurisdiction over the ocean shoreline.These monopolistic situations with high avoidance costs were, however, still plausible variants of the right to collect taxes or tolls. According to Hale, when such a monopoly was either expressly a franchise granted by the king or was a toll-taking monopoly owned by prescription, the owner of the monopoly had to charge a reasonable rate. Hale describes such a franchise as "a right privilege, that no man may set up a common ferry for all passengers without a prescription time out of mind or a charter from the king. He may make a ferry for his own use or the use of his family, but not for the common use of all the king's subjects passing that way; because it doth in consequent tend to a common charge, and is become a thing of public interest and use, and every man for his passage pays a toll, which is a common charge, and every [such] ferry ought to be under a public regulation, viz., that it give attendance at due times, keep a boat in due order, and take but reasonable toll; for if he fail in these he is finable." As long as the property right is equivalent to the monopoly of taking a toll on a road, the property is "affected with a public interest." This interest, however, terminates if competition arises. If the situation is not or is no longer the equivalent of taking the toll -- i.e. if it does not involve "all" the king's subjects who travel that way -- freedom of contract (i.e. property rights in motion) must govern:A man, for his own private advantage, may, in a port or town, set up a wharf or crane, and may take what rates he and his customers can agree for cranage, wharfage, housellage, pesage; for he doth no more than is lawful for any man to do, viz., makes the most of his own. If the king or subject have a public wharf, unto which all persons that come to that port must come and unlade or lade their goods as for the purpose, because they are the wharves only licensed by the king, or because there is no other wharf in that port, as it may fall out where a port is newly erected, in that case there cannot be taken arbitrary and excessive duties for cranage, wharfage, pesage, &c.; neither can they be enhanced to an immoderate rate, but the duties must be reasonable and moderate, though settled by the king's license or charter. For now the wharf and crane and other conveniences are affected with a public interest, and they cease to be juris privati only; as if a man set out a street in new building on his own land, it is now no longer bare private interest, but is affected by the public interest.Up to here the public interest was required to justify a common law restriction on a franchise. In medieval and Renaissance times, on rare occassions Parliamentary statutes, and much more commonly local lords and guilds, regulated property in motion, with various oppressive or economically dubious laws that fixed prices, set maximum wages, and the like. These regulations were not considered part of the common law and were not justified in terms of the public interest doctrine. However, in the U.S. the Fourteenth Amendment was commonly held by legal scholars and judges to apply common law restrictions to statutory law, and that included restricting regulation of private property by the public interest doctrine as it had been explicated by Hale. The Waite, Peckham, and Taft Courts all agreed that the public interest doctrine restricted the ability both state and federal legislatures to regulate private property, but in the process of applying the doctrine in this way the Supreme Court ended up stretching it beyond all recognition, until it just broke.This conflict between the legislative desire to regulate property and the common law restrictions incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment came to a head little more than a decade after the ratification of that Amendment. The common law doctrine of public interest was applied to restrict legislation, but it was even in the first case stretched to allow legislation that was far from regulation of any sort of private police power or toll-taking.In Munn v. Illinois (US. Supreme Court 1877) the public interest doctrine was rather dubiously extended to a set of grain elevator situated near a major railroad hub in Chicago. These elevators sorted and stored grain and thus played an important role in the shipment and trading of grain. Their construction and operation had greatly expanded the ability of Midwest U.S. farmers to market their products, but now the farmers had complained about the high prices charged and successfully lobbied, via a political lobbying group called the Grangers, for Illlinois to regulate the rates charged by the elevators for storing grain.Munn's elevators did not comprise all (or even most) of the elevators near the hub. There were several companies operating such elevators, albeit they had been accused of collusion. Nevertheless, there is an economic rationale for extending the public interest doctrine to what Professor Richard Epstein calls network companies -- companies like public utilities and railroads. Given the exclusive contracts between railroads and the grain elevators, and anti-scompetitive collusion between the elevator companies itself, the network doctrine could plausibly be further extended from the railroads to the elevators. Whether or not it was justifiable on policy grounds, Munn was a radical redefinition of the public interest doctrine. No longer was the doctrine confined to performing governmental functions, i.e. running courts and police forces and collecting taxes and tolls, when the rights to conduct such activities were privately owned. Now the public interest doctrine applied to purely commercial enterprises that were not purely competitive but were associated with some uncompetitive practices or outcomes.The network or anticompetitive theory lasted for a little over seventy years, but it was easy for courts to extend this doctrine, since no commercial enterprise is purely competitive. Indeed, as Professor Epstein has described, the Progressive and pro-New Deal judges thought highly regulated monopolies or cartels were the ideal form of business for most sectors of the economy. In Nebbia v. New York (U.S. Supreme Court 1934) Justice Roberts declared that the public interest doctrine justified almost arbitrary and discrimanatory regulation of property:The court has repeatedly sustained curtailment of enjoyment of private property, in the public interest. The owner's rights may be subordinated to the needs of other private owners whose pursuits are vital to the paramount interests of the community. The state may control the use of property in various ways; may prohibit advertising bill boards except of a prescribed size and location, or their use for certain kinds of advertising; may in certain circumstances authorize encroachments by party walls in cities; may fix the height of buildings, the character of materials, and methods of construction, the adjoining area which must be left open, and may exclude from residential sections offensive trades, industries and structures likely injuriously to affect the public health or safety; or may establish zones within which certain types of buildings or businesses are permitted and others excluded. And although the Fourteenth Amendment extends protection to aliens as well as citizens, a state may for adequate reasons of policy exclude aliens altogether from the use and occupancy of land [citations omitted].In terms of what local lords and legislatures had actually regulated over the course of history this was accurate. In the context of the history of franchise law, on which Hale's public interest doctrine was based, and which the Fourteenth Amendment had been held to incorporate, but which Justice Roberts had forgotten, this interpretation of the public interest doctrine was absurd. "Public interest" now refered, not to coercive police powers, not to toll-taking, not to toll-like monopolies, not to businesses with network externalities, but simply to the ubiquitous condition of scarcity, used in NBC v. U.S. (U.S. Supreme Court 1943) even to deny First Amendment claims against content-related FCC regulations:The facilities of radio are limited and therefore precious; they cannot be left to wasteful use without detriment to the public interest.The Waite Court's application of the doctrine to network-like businesses generally, including not just railroads but also semi-monopolistic depots standing beside railroads, had already stetched the doctrine well beyond toll-taking proper. Now the doctrine was simply smashed down altogether by the New Deal hurricane.
Today the concept of personal jurisdiction -- the freedom of a government to take action against a particular person for the purposes of enforcing a law -- is largely based around the idea that a "sovereign state" has personal jurisdiction over the persons and activities within its territory. But in many times and places this has not been so. Under the system of political property rights in most of medieval Western Europe, for example, the kings had their political property rights, and the lords had theirs. Both were governed by the same basic laws of property, including laws of right (title), trespass, and inheritance. The result was a sophisticated system of jurisdiction based on property rights rather than sovereign rule.Both kings and lords had an incentive to respect each other's political and economic property. This is illustrated by a speech that Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Duke of York in Richard II, when King Richard is threatening to (under somewhat dubious legal arguments) confiscate the exiled Duke of Hereford's estates and franchises (i.e. both his economic and political property rights). Indeed, a major theme of the tragedy is that since the king failed to respect political property rights, his own end up being overturned. Note that "royalties" and "franchises" are synonyms used for political property rights -- they are the same kinds of property rights as the king himself holds, and alliterative redundant pairs like (e.g. "royalties and rights") were common in legal language as well as in Shakespeare:O my liege,Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleasedNot to be pardon'd, am content withal.Seek you to seize and gripe into your handsThe royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?....Take Hereford's rights away, and take from TimeHis charters and his customary rights;Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;Be not thyself; for how art thou a kingBut by fair sequence and succession?The king's own rights to his realm are, in other words, based on the same property law as the jurisdictions of the dukes, burghers, and other franchise owners. Abrogate the law for others and it could easily be abrogated for the king. But the long era of political property rights would end with the coming of republicansim and democracy because Parliament and other legislatures do not share this coincidence of interests. Only the dawn of an independent court saved economic property rights in England and America -- but it was insufficient to save political property rights, especially those of jurisdiction which the "sovereign" courts seized for themselves.The late medieval English case of Upton v. Le Mazerer provides a great illustration of personal jurisdiction based on political property rights rather than sovereignty. To get the most out of the following you should have a basic idea what a life estate and reversion are. The basic issue of the case is whether the the tenant holds property of the lord as a "sokeman" tenant (in which case the lord has jurisdiction) or whether the lord had granted the tenant a release from jurisdiction, making the tenant a "frank" tenant which meant the king had jurisdiction. The meanings of all these will become clearer as you read through the following description of the case, taken from my paper "Jurisdiction as Property."Our cast has several players:(1) Lord Hugh, ancestor of the current lord.(2) Hugh, a tenant of the Lord Hugh. As the curtain opens on the facts of the case, Hugh is a sokeman tenant of Hugh the lord, and thus Hugh the lord starts with personal jurisdiction over Hugh the tenant.(3) The current lord, heir of Lord Hugh.(4) The current tenant, heir of Hugh the tenant.In Upton v. Le Mazerer a “writ of right according to the custom of the manor,” a dispute over lands of the manor, was removed...from the manorial court because the tenant party claimed to hold in frank-fee rather than as a sokeman of the lord of the manor. If this was the case the king, not the lord of the manor had personal jurisdiction over the tenant.The agreed facts were that Hugh, ancestor of the current lord, had granted to Hugh, a sokeman tenant (i.e. a tenant then under the jurisdiction of Hugh the lord), the same lands that Hugh already held of his lord, but in “frank,” thus releasing Hugh the tenant from the lord’s to the king’s jurisdiction. The current tenant, a successor to the tenant Hugh, claimed the grant was frank-fee, i.e. [in the king's jurisdiction] “for all time”, while the current lord, an heir to Hugh the lord, agreed that it was a grant of freedom from the lord’s jurisdiction but argued that the grant was only for “a term of life.” The current lord, heir of Hugh the lord, argued that “we are claiming these tenements as ancient demesne from the seisin of [our] ancestor, which is higher in time than this deed” In modern terms, the lord of the manor was claiming that the tenant now held only the reversion of the life estate, which was just the original sokeman fee held of the lord of the manor, and thus that the lord of the manor had regained jurisdiction over the tenant. The outcome of the case thus hinged on whether the grant adding to the tenancy freedom from the lord’s jurisdiction was for a term of life or a perpetual fee. The outcome of this factual issue was not reported, but the reporter observed that “if it be found that Hugh [the tenant] had fee, the original writ, which remained in the lord’s court, would abate...[a]nd if it be found that he only had for a term of life, then the parties shall go back to the lord’s court, and plead with regard to the original etc.” The personal jurisdiction of each court was entirely contingent on the outcome of the property issue: as one Scrope (either a justice favorable to the lord, or one of the lord’s barristers) observed, “[t]he scope of the averment is only to determine whether the tenements ought to be tried here or sent back to the lord’s court.” The reporter also noted main property law issue on which jurisdiction hinged: “[w]hen a man recovers tenements from his ancestor’s seisin, he shall recover the tenements in the state wherein his ancestors held them, and all deeds made in the meantime between the ancestor’s recovery and the seisin will be defeated by this recovery.”
Dennis Crouch has a good review of and links to the petitioner's brief and several amicus brief in LabCorp v. Metabolite.  This case may impact the patentability of software and business methods.   I have described in a paper how software came to be patentable in the United States, when our Supreme Court has held "mathematical algorithms" to be unpatentable subject matter.
The United States Constitution is often lauded as the epitome of freedom.  And indeed, the U.S. has for most of its history sat far towards the "more free" end of the spectrum of actual governments.  The original Colonies, Articles of Confederation, and the first hundred years of the United States Constitution were, with some glaring exceptions, among the most libertarian of governments in human history, and far more libertarian than the modern United States.  The actual text of our Constitution, read straightfowardly under standard English definitions, or read as most lawyers read it when enacted, is (with the exception of the Sixteenth Amendment, the income tax) a fringe libertarian document.  Of all the 2008 Presidential primary candidates only the libertarian Ron Paul could credibly base his platform on the actual text and original meaning of the Constitution.   The positions of all the other major candidates, as well as the interpretations of most of our Supreme Court justices, depart very far from the actual text in its original meaning.  But our Constitution is nevertheless deeply flawed.  In a number of ways it facilitates our slow slide into socialism and tyranny.  It is rather easy for Congressmen, Presidents, and federal justices who wish to interpret it as granting broad powers and narrow rights to do so, and they have been doing so ever since the Constitution was enacted.  A wide variety of other constitutional mechanisms and institutions would do a far better job at slowing and reversing the death of liberty in the modern world.Much of the early liberty of the American Colonies and the early United States was, as Adam Smith observed, due to low exit costs.  Farming was the dominant economic activity, and the availability of free land out West made it relatively easy for a farmer to move if the local conditions got too oppressive.  Officials had to preserve liberty to keep their populations.  Nevertheless, our Constitution among other factors kept the U.S. more libertarian than Russia, which also had a large frontier.  Our Constitution slowed, but did not stop, the aggrandizement of power into effectively unaccountable and increasingly oppresive forms.   While there are many more ways to make it worse than to make it better, and this author does not recommend constitutional convention or military coup, those trying to set up new constitutions, or amend their old ones, should observe that there are a number of crucially important ways in which the U.S. Constitution can be improved upon.Speaking very broadly, the general problem with our Constitution is that it allows the rise of a fully sovereign and monolithic federal power.   Such an entity inevitably aggrandizes its power and ultimately cannot make credible commitments to protect property or any other rights or powers that it covets for itself.  This is a common flaw of modern constitutions, but there are a number of protective mechanisms which these constitutions do not employ, or employ incorrectly, that could be brought to bear to correct this general problem.A bit more specifically, here are most of the major flaws in the U.S. Constitution:(1) The legislative branch is too powerful: several of the grants of power in Article I are too broadly worded and the rules for interpreting them are insufficiently strict.  Once legislatures have achieved broad powers, they can hardly be expected to vote to give those powers up.   It's a one-way ratchet towards socialism and tyranny.(2) The executive branch is too powerful: executive duties are not well defined and the non-delegation doctrine is not enforced, allowing the rise of permanent unelected lawmaking bureaucracies.   (In many practical ways the real constitution the post-New Deal U.S. operates under is the Administrative Procedures Act, augmented by things like Chevron deference).(3) There is far too much use of elections and far too little use of lotteries.  A number of officials should be chosen by lottery (as in ancient Athens) or by a sequential election/lottery cycle (as in the Venetian Republic).   Lotteries can be very good at solving public choice problems, such as the problem of concentrated lobbying during elections which trump widely distributed preference.(4) One of the two gravest defects lies in how courts are structured with respect to the constitutions they interpret.   A basic design pattern for good government is that officials should not be interpreters of their own power.  Allowing federal courts to interpret federal powers and state courts to interpret state powers has led to inevitable aggrandizement of the powers of both: to broad interpretations of power-granting clauses.  Vague constitutional language, which is practically inevitable, would not lead to tyranny if the judiciaries who have final say interpreting these clauses did not have incentives to expand these powers.   This effect is exacerbated by allowing the legislature and executive to choose the judges.   I am  afraid that, for example, Professor Barnett's proposal for convincing federal courts to (in many ways return to) libertarian interpretations of our Constitution, desirable as such interpretions are, is nevertheless futile.  Incentives operate to select judges who profess broad interpretations of power, and while sitting on the court for judges to further aggrandize governmental power.  Our judicial structure is another one-way ratchet towards tyranny.A much better (but hardly the only better) proposal for selecting judges: select judges for lower courts by lottery from among lawyers who have scored in the upper percentile on the state bar exam and have been practicing for at least 5 years.  Select judges for higher courts by a lottery over the judges of lower courts who have at least five years experience on the bench.  Judges can still be impeached and removed for by legislatures or independent tribunals for egregious illegal behavior, but the executive and legislature play no role in selecting judges in the first place.  This makes the judiciary far more independent of the executive and legislative branches.The basic structure of courts in the American colonies was far better than our structure under the Constitution.  There, the Privy Council, not colonial courts, had the final say in interpreting colonial charters.  Being more dependent on Parliament and the Crown than on the colonial legislature, it had no incentive to aggrandize the power of the colonial legislatures.   There were also a number of flaws in colonial government, including deep flaws in the British constitution that allowed the rise of Parliamentary sovereignty, which both compromised the independence of the Privy Council and trespassed on colonial legislative powers.  There was also the practical problem of distance that made appeals to the Privy Council in London far too infrequent.   But the basic appeals structure was far superior to that of our current Constitution.    The colonial court structure will work far better now without the delay problem and if the highest court is not itself tied to a legislature.(5) The other of the two gravest defects is the lack of unbundled political property rights.   Federalism and separation of functions are two very good, indeed crucial, features of the Constitution, but they are insufficient for protecting liberty.   Unbundled rights to engage in narrow forms of coercive legal procedure are  often a far better way to distribute power than hierarchical federalism and separation of powers in an entity that is supposed to be in totality sovereign.   The gothi of medieval Iceland, often cited by anarcho-capitalists, were an example of a political property right.   Medieval and Renaissance England was a world full of polycentric, or highly distributed,  political property rights, but these were swallowed up by legislative powers in colonial America.  We must revive this very important and legally mature method of distributing political powers.  Many legislative, executive, and judicial functions should be granted to private entities as political property rights, with the jurisdictional boundaries and procedural standards defined in those rights to be enforced by an extraordinary court independent of all other governmental entities.(6) Insufficient protection is given to, and scope allowed for, choice-of-forum and choice-of-law clauses.   Much, though by no means all, law could be entered into by contractual agreement, allowing for healthy forms of legal competition in certain areas, such as contract and family law.
Nicholas Carr complains about the lack of human intervention in the calculation of many web search engine rankings. This popular viewpoint is like the silly final scene in the original Star Wars movie: turn off that darned machine and "trust the force, Luke." Never mind that web searches, like the torpedo or whatever that destroyed the Death Star, necessarily require complex technology, or that the algorithm can make billions of decisions in the time it would take Carr or myself or a Chinese firewall operator to make one. Carr bitterly complains that some commentary that he and I and Martin Luther King would find quite disagreeable comes first when you Google for "Martin Luther King." Out of trillions of possible short search phrases, Google's algorithm can be shown to produce an occasional poor result -- oh my!Carr would thus like to substitute human judgment -- or more precisely, the judgment of some human who agrees with him -- for Google's algorithm. He makes the robotic assumption that a human is automatically more trustworthy than robot. After all, we are much more cuddly than robots. Like the humans that run the Chinese firewall, he fails to add.But automata have often served as authority to great human benefit. In late medieval times, mechanical clocks replaced more erroneous or subjective time measures such as the sun or personal inclination. The result was that we be became better coordinated in all sorts of ways. The calculator on a cash register cuts way down on disputes over counting change. Entire professions like accounting, auditing, and the law, among others, exist because human strangers cannot, and should not overly pretend to, trust each other without some highly evolved, verifiable, and often repeatedly mechanical institutions. In other words, processes and rules.Human trust requires being able to tell the "good guys" from the "bad guys." That only occurs among people who know each other well (and otherwise, in fiction). People who have gotten a close look underneath often misleading robes. For every other kind of relationship we depend on those loathsome processes and rules, as objective as possible. Whether we like to admit it or not, and we usually don't. And the people who don't are proud to say so. They sound like much more agreeable people if they just trust everybody, and expect everybody to trust them, regardless of how well they know or are known. Call them the Hello Kitty people. Until proven otherwise, each and every one of the six-plus billion people on the planet are angelic and adorable fuzzballs who can be fully trusted by everyone. Until disillusioned, Hello Kitty people purr with content. And thereby they come across as the most adorable of us all. As opposed to computer programmers or lawyers with our cold hard rules.The Hello Kitty people are those teenagers who put their personal lives on MySpace and then complain that their privacy is being violated. They are the TV viewers who think that the Hurricane Katrina rescue or the Iraq war were screwed up only because we don't, they belatedly discover, have actual Hello Kitties in political power. When inevitably some of world's Kitties, unknown beyond their cute image, turn out to be less than fully trustworthy, the chorus of yowling Kitty People becomes unbearable cacophony.The people who run search engines and other remote Internet companies are generally not our families, nor our close friends. They are not organizations we can come to trust merely based on their humanity. When it comes to strangers, human judgment is often far less verifiable, and thus far less accountable, than an algorithmic intermediary. When stranger trusts stranger, human judgment all too easily turns into human corruption. How many examples of strangers, or nearly so, killing each other, lying to each other, stealing from each other, and so on do you need in the news every day to be convinced that many strangers have other things on their mind besides your welfare? (Hint: the headlines are just the tip of the iceberg. Strangers harming strangers are vastly more common than an algorithmic Google ranking we'd all agree is erroneous).With large institutions staffed by strangers (e.g. a big search engine company), the human appearances can be far more deceiving than for the people we know and therefore can rationally trust without the help of verified performance of rules. Among strangers a computer program, at least an open source one or one whose results can readily be tested by third parties, is often much fairer and far less corruptible than human judgment. The highly controversial area of web search rankings is probably one of the areas where this is the case. I usually trust simple objective ranking algorithms (e.g. those based on counting links) long before I trust the censorship of ideologized strangers like Carr or the censorious bozos on the Chinese firewall. But our emotional instincts evolved in small little tribes, and so there will always be countless Hello Kitty People to decry all these cold hard rules and programs in favor of their own fuzzy and cuddly illusions. If the world were just a fiction movie, or just a little happy tribe, I'd quite agree with them.
The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to hear Massachusetts v. EPA, a challenge by some states in federal court to force the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide even absent specific instructions to do so from Congress.  This case is related to the non-delegation doctrine, the origins of which I have written about in a paper.  However, the non-delegation doctrine will probably not be reached since the EPA (which like other regulatatory agencies and the Justice Department hates the doctrine, as it enforces democratic oversight) is defending the case.  Thus the EPA and its opponents are staking out  their arguments around the issue of whether EPA must regulate carbon dioxide, not around the issue of  whether it can.  Under the non-delegation doctrine as Madison and most other Founders understood it, and as it was understood by the Supreme Court until the late 1930s, the EPA should not be able to regulate carbon dioxide even if it wanted to, absent specific instructions from Congress to do so.Despite the EPA not having properly raised the non-delegation issue, it is highly likely that several court conservatives wish the EPA would raise it, and possibly might raise it themselves, although normally they are loathe to raise issues that the parties have not properly raised.  Indeed, the Court (with the concurrence of all the conservative justices) recently dismissed a case because the party based its Supreme Court appeal around an issue that it had not properly raised in the lower courts.   However it's possible that an argument of the auto industry intervenors could be construed as properly raising the non-delegation issue, although their argument is fairly narrow: that Congress has already delegated authority over carbon dioxide to a different agency.The state challenge to the EPA was rejected at the circuit court level and has very little chance of succeeding at the Supreme Court, but it will be interesting to hear the various reasons the justices will give for rejecting it.
Atomic clock on a chip for about $1,500.  Accurate and independent clocks improve secure synchronous protocols, in other words can help securely determine the order in which events occur on the Internet, wireless, and other networks while minimizing dependence on trusted third parties like GPS.   The technology nicely complements secure timestamping (see e.g. here, here, and here) which can leave an unforgeable record of the ordering of events and the times at which specific data or documents existed.Bitcoin, an implementation of the bit gold idea (and another example of where the order of events is important), continues to be popular.It is finally being increasingly realized that there are many "squishy" areas where scientific methods don't work as well as they do in hard sciences like physics and chemistry.  Including psychology, significant portions of medicine, ecology, and I'd add the social sciences, climate, and nutrition.  These areas are often hopelessly infected with subjective judgments about results, so it's not too surprising that when the the collective judgments change about what constitutes, for example, the "health" of a mind, body, society, or ecosystem, that the "results" of experiments as defined in terms of these judgments change as well.  See also "The Trouble With Science".Flat sats (as I like to call them) may help expand our mobility in the decades ahead.  Keith Lofstrom proposes fabricating an entire portion of a phased array communications satellite -- solar cells, radios, electronics, computation, etc. -- on a single silicon wafer.   Tens of thousands or more of these, each nearly a foot wide, may be launched on a single small rocket.  If they're thin enough, orientation and orbit can be maintained using light pressure (like a solar sail).  Medium-term application: phased array broadcast of TV or data allows much smaller ground antennas, perhaps even satellite TV and (mostly downlink) Internet in your phone, iPad, or laptop.  Long-term: lack of need for structure to hold together an array of flat sats may bring down the cost of solar power in space to the point that we can put the power-hungry server farms of Internet companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. in orbit.  Biggest potential problem: large numbers of these satellites may both create and be vulnerable to micrometeors and other space debris.

What are the top three amendments you would like to see to the United States Constitution?  James Buchanan proposes three.  I think something quite like the latter two are already implied by broad clauses in our Constitution, but in the coming era of "conservative" Footnote Four justices, it would be good to reify them as specific textual amendments.  Here's my take on Buchanan's three proposed amendments:1. Fiscal responsibility -- requires a super-majority vote by the Congress to run a federal budget deficit.  This is a good idea, but since it would provide political cover for Congress to raise taxes, I'd add a requirement of a super-majority to raise taxes, which can be found in some state constitutions.2. Non-discriminatory politics -- Based on Hayek's proposed amendment -- “Congress shall make no law authorizing government to take any discriminatory measures of coercion.”  Actually, this is the original meaning of both the General Welfare and Equal Protection Clauses, but it would be nice to add more specificity so that our courts would actually enforce them.  I think the biggest issue here is that the Equal Protection Clause is currently treated as applying various levels of scrutiny to a handful of "suspect" (race) "intermediate" (gender), and "rationality with teeth" (age, sexual orientation, etc.) classifications.  What should happen is that any classification made in any law, from "violent felons" to "infants", whether it be "employees" or "employers", ought to be examined under at least the Lawrence "rationality with teeth" standard.  In other words, every law ought to be independently reviewable by the courts with respect to any of the distinctions it makes between different types of people, as to whether those distinctions are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.3. I'm not clear on what Buchanan's third proposal is, but I'm guessing it's encapsulated by "the natural liberty to enter into and exit from agreements."  During the era between the Allgeyer and Nebbia cases (1897-1934) the United States Supreme Court recognized a right along these lines, sometimes called "freedom of contract."  Modern cases from Griswold to Lawrence have established rights in more intimate relationships. As I suggested in my previous post, I'm greatly in favor of freedomm of contract in principle, but it's difficult to specify what it would involve in practice.  There are detailed common law precedents and statutes (the Uniform Commercical Code as enacted in the states) governing contract law.  Under these precedents and statutes contracts are often found to be unenforceable, as has always been the case at common law.  I propose instead the following amendment: "No right of contract or property shall be infringed with the purpose or effect of unduly burdening choice in intimate relationships or medical services, or the control of parent over child."  It still needs work, and we might like to add to or subtract from the list of protected categories, but I think it's a big improvement over the vague "freedom of contract." This kind of protection is already implied (IMHO) by substantive due process cases from Allgeyer and Pierce v. Society of Sisters to Griswold and Casey.  However, with justices hostile to this libertarian tradition, we may soon have an urgent need to reify these rights in the form of specific constitutional amendments.
"Super Tuesday" here in the United States is coming up next week and the primaries are still undecided and exciting.  My favorite candidate, Ron Paul, finished second in the Nevada caucus, has picked up at least 6 convention delegates so far, and is now one of four major candidates remaining in the Republican race, albeit trailing the other three in most states.  He has outlasted Tom Tancredo, Duncan Hunter, Fred Thompson, and Rudy Guliani.  He will likely continue his pattern of doing better in most caucus states than in primary states, reflecting the higher energy of his supporters.   Here are some video highlights of Paul at the recent debate at the Ronald Reagan Library.   Here is a chart comparing his major positions to the other candidates.Dr. Paul has recently picked up a wide variety of endorsements: contrast Arlo Guthrie with American Conservative magazine, for example.   His new book, The Revolution: A Manifesto, is now near the top of the Amazon best-seller list.   Paul has introduced many more people to the ideas of liberty than we could have hoped for even a few months ago.   Go Ron Go![Update 2/2/08 -- here is video of a good speech Paul just gave in Colorado, and Paul is currently tied for second with John McCain in today's Maine caucus.][Update 2/7/08 -- On "Super Tuesday" Paul did much better in caucuses than in primaries, as I predicted.  He did particularly well in northern state caucuses.  In Montana he placed 2nd with 25% of the vote.  In North Dakota he got 21%, in Alaska 17%, and Minnesota 16%.  Paul won well over a dozen counties outright, including (ironically) Lincoln and Roosevelt counties and (fittingly) Madison county in Montana.  His campaign reports that he now has at least 42 delegates to the Republican national convention.  This corresponds to hundreds of delegates at the local level who will influence Republican party politics for years into the future.  Even Mitt Romney has now dropped out of the race, but Ron Paul keeps plugging away.  Here [1,2,3] is video of Ron Paul's excellent speech at CPAC, wonderfully introduced by Bob Barr.
Unable to otherwise explain today's high commodity prices, Frank Veneroso and others fear we are in a commodity bubble.  Exhibit A is the recent vast increase in the use of commodity derivatives[*]:Here's how Veneroso observes the unprecedented state of our commodity markets:Though the six-fold increase in such positions over a few brief years is dramatic , it is the magnitude of these positions that is most alarming...It is hard to know what to make of this data. But it is noteworthy that several years ago, at the then prevailing lower commodity prices, the entire above ground stock of all commodity inventories was only in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if only a fraction of the increase in global commodity derivative aggregates in recent years corresponds to a net long position of investors or speculators, implying speculative and investment positions of a “few trillions of dollars,” it would appear that this increased demand for commodity derivative positions has overwhelmed what have been relatively small markets...No wonder, then, that this cycle’s bull market in commodity prices has gone higher in inflation-adjusted terms [i.e. in terms of the CPI and PPI -- a poor near-term measure of inflation, see below] and for longer than in all prior uninterrupted half-decade cycles in the past.I agree with Veneroso that the recent commodities boom has a strong causal link to the recent rise in the amount and variety of commodity derivatives.  But I couldn't disagree with him more about the role of inflation.  Prices, and especially wages, react very slowly to changes in money supply, so that the CPI and PPI are trailing indicators.   The leading indicators are increases in money supply in excess to increased demand for money and the associated (if disproportionate) increases in commodity prices.  M3, an estimate of the supply of dollars (including a reconstructed estimate for recent years).  M3 is increasing at the highest rate since the 1970s, as are to a lesser extent the supplies of euros and other major currencies, resulting in a commodity boom not seen since the 1970s. Source: nowandfutures.comThe recent vast increase in commodity derivatives, and the resulting commodity boom, is a largely rational response to the vast increase in the supply, relative to demand, for the dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and most other major currencies during most of the last decade.  This despite the fact that commodities prices have in the last year risen (at about 40%/year) much faster than the growth of money supply (about 15%/yr).  To see why, observe that one of the most useful but least talked about uses of derivatives is their ability to simulate the economic behavior (primarily risk and return) of one kind of asset based on contracts for another kind of asset or performed in another legal environment.  The classic example is Eurodollars. But let's take a general scenario:Alice wants to promise Bob to transfer asset X.  But the risks associated with Bob holding asset X on his balance sheet, or Alice holding liability X on her balance sheet, until actual transfer of the asset, are too high, or the transaction costs of actually transfering X from Alice to Bob are too high, or both.(1) Solution for risks of holding asset X on books: derivatives.  Alice has both assets and liabilities on her books.  These have individual and net risks just like an investment portfolio.  If Alice has the same amount of assets and liabilities all denominated in the same currency, her portfolio is balanced.  But if, for example, she imports from Europe (thus creating liabilities in euros) and sells in the U.S. (creating assets in dollars), her portfolio becomes strongly subject to risk of dollar devaluation against the euro.  If a new asset or liability creates such unbalanced risk, it can be hedged with derivatives.(2) Solution for transaction cost of transferring asset X from Alice to Bob: use derivatives to create a synthetic asset.  Construct from derivatives and asset Y a synthetic asset that economically behaves like asset X.   These separate derivatives and asset Y that form the synthetic all can be transfered with low transaction costs, thus forming an asset economically equivalent to asset X but that, unlike X, can be transferred from Alice to Bob at low cost.The reason these uses of derivatives are seldom talked about is that the main cause of problem (1) is the instability of government currencies that it is legally necessary (for a variety of reasons) for  contracts to be denominated in.  The cause of problem (2) is usually a legal barrier to a particular transaction -- a tax, exchange control, risk caused by regulation, or risk of confiscation in Bob's jurisdiction are four examples.  People who route around the law tend to do so quietly, explaining their acts by euphemism, even if as here the new route is perfectly legal and is made necessary by deep flaws in the law or the way the law is executed.There are often, in other words, huge discrepencies between the contract terms required or incentivized by law and the most economically efficient contract terms. Partly this is due to political stupidity, and partly to the inevitable profound imperfection of any body of rules.(3) A third function of derivatives is simply as a store of value: a way to diversify or hedge inflation risk in an investment portfolio that otherwise contains either (a) debt denominated in a potentially inflating currency, (b) equity in companies with assets consisting mainly of debts denominated in a potentially inflating currency, or (c) both.In performing functions (1) and (2), derivatives usually substitute for or augment currencies as a medium of exchange.  For (3) they substitute for or augment the monetary function of a store of value.  Most derivatives, in other words, perform largely monetary functions.  They augment or substitute for a flawed method of payment or a flawed store of value.Gold prices in dollars (and, not pictured here, the dollar prices of many other commonly traded commodities) roughly follow changes in the global monetary base of dollars. Source: nowandfutures.comIn a climate where one or more commonly used currencies are inflating (and by "inflation" I simply mean rise in money supply without concurrent rise in demand for that currency, not the CPI or any particular and usually trailing measure of inflation), derivatives, if they can be analyzed and traded at low cost, are very much in demand.   Furthermore, if all of the currencies practically available for contractual payment terms are inflating, these derivatives will come to be increasingly based, not on currency-denominated debt, but on commodities, especially commodities for which supply and demand are relatively inelastic in the short and medium terms.Why is it rational, rather than reflecting a bubble, for the recent rise in commodity prices to outpace the recent rise in money supply?  The rise in commodity prices reflects the increase not just in supply of dollars per unit of commodity, but greatly increased demand for a commodity as money, i.e. for the monetary functions it serves either directly or indirectly via derivatives, on top of the relatively steady demand for consumption.  As I have argued elsewhere, this increase is broad-based: all commodities that can be traded with low transaction costs on modern markets, and that exhibit short- and medium-term inelasticity of supply and consumption demand, are useful for and are being used as reserves for the new derivative currencies.  Where computerized analysis lowers mental transaction costs, as with modern derivatives, it pays to diversify one's books, portfolios, and hedges among multiple currencies.Of course, the traditional use of commodities futures and derivatives by commodity producers and consumers to hedge the assets and liabilities of the commodity sales and purchases inherent in their business continues.  But these don't account for the vast majority of commodity derivatives use in recent years.Before modern computers, networks, and software engineering, the cost of such derivatives was usually prohibitive.   In the last period of monetary inflation and the resulting commodity boom, the 1970s, derivatives were available to few and only the very simplest hedges or synthetic assets could be understood, and even then very imperfectly.  Today derivatives, and their use in very complex hedges and synthetic assets, are much better understood by most of their users, thanks to computerized game tree analysis, and are available to many.  They can be designed, simulated, and traded electronically with very low transaction costs.  Computerized derivatives are  smart contracts that lower mental transaction costs. So much so, that they've created a vast new world of contractual relationships completely impossible with the brain alone.Speaking perhaps a bit metaphorically, we are witnessing the rise of new and privately issued fractional reserve currencies.  They need not and effectively cannot legally be called "money" by their "issuers", nor can they effectively be used directly in most contracts for payments.  But they can be used indirectly to hedge payment terms or investments denominated in flawed, that is in inflating or otherwise unstable, government currencies in which normal contracts and instruments are generally denominated.  The results are synthetic "currencies" that, in their economic behavior, may be almost indistinguishable from a tradtional commodity-backed and privately issued fractional reserve currency. No wonder the Federal Reserve and other central banks are moving hard to usurp jurisdiction over derivatives (per, for example, the recently announced Paulsen plan here in the U.S. to consolidate a variety of financial regulation under the Federal Reserve).  To effectively regulate derivatives, for better or worse, the Fed will have to understand them first.  But they do not have this knowledge.  Indeed no human brain holds this knowledge.  The knowledge needed to understand the dizzying variety of derivatives exists mainly in the form of computer simulations.   Derivatives, the money of the digital era, perform monetary functions in competition with the Federal Reserve's dollars, an increasingly primitive holdover of the paper era.  By regulating derivatives the Federal Reserve regulates its competition.  This creates a profound conflict of interest.  It's like putting Rust Belt executives in charge of Silicon Valley. Such regulation may cause, not the popping of a commodity bubble, but the destruction of a nascent economic order made necessary by the prediliction of the Federal Reserve and other central banks to inflate their fiat currencies. Whether ignorance or conflict of interest will play the greater role in the destruction of the new currencies, or whether one will cancel the other out leaving the derivatives markets in relative freedom, remains to be seen.[Obligatory Wikipedia links: Eurodollars, elasticity][H/T: I learned of Venero's paper from Byrne Hobart][Here's a prior explanation of mine giving a broader overview of why commodity prices reflect demand for their monetary functions as well as for their consumption, but not explaining the role of derivatives].[*] These numbers are a bit stale -- it would be great to see to what extent this growth has continued.  If any reader has data on commodity derivative use through 2007, please let me know.[UPDATE: here is more straightforward article that gets the basic facts right: production up, inventories up, consumption down, prices up -- inexplicable if consumption is the only major source of demand -- but gets the explanation wrong, replacing the rational and efficient use of commodity derivatives as money that I have described here with the typical speculations about "speculation" resulting in a "bubble"].[Ad: I am now providing consulting services.]
The USPTO has agreed, per Peter Calveley's request. to re-examine claim #11, the most notorious portion of Amazon's "one-click" patent.
A long time ago I hit upon the idea of bit gold.  The problem, in a nutshell, is that our money currently depends on trust in a third party for its value.  As many inflationary and hyperinflationary episodes during the 20th century demonstrated, this is not an ideal state of affairs.   Similarly, private bank note issue, while it had various advantages as well as disadvantages, similarly depended on a trusted third party.Precious metals and collectibles have an unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation.  This once provided money the value of which was largely independent of any trusted third party.  Precious metals have problems, however.  It's too costly to assay metals repeatedly for common transactions.  Thus a trusted third party (usually associated with a tax collector who accepted the coins as payment) was invoked to stamp a standard amount of the metal into a coin.  Transporting large values of metal can be a rather insecure affair, as the British found when transporting gold across a U-boat infested Atlantic to Canada during World War I to support their gold standard.  What's worse, you can't pay online with metal.Thus, it would be very nice if there were a protocol whereby unforgeably costly bits could be created online with minimal dependence on trusted third parties, and then securely stored, transferred, and assayed with similar minimal trust.  Bit gold.My proposal for bit gold is based on computing a string of bits from a string of challenge bits, using functions called variously "client puzzle function," "proof of work function," or "secure benchmark function.".   The resulting string of bits is the proof of work.  Where a one-way function is prohibitively difficult to compute backwards, a secure benchmark function ideally comes with a specific cost, measured in compute cycles, to compute backwards.  Here are the main steps of the bit gold system that I envision:(1) A public string of bits, the "challenge string," is created (see step 5).(2) Alice on her computer generates the proof of work string from the challenge bits using a benchmark function.(3) The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on.(4) Alice adds the challenge string and the timestamped proof of work string to a distributed property title registryfor bit gold.  Here, too, no single server is substantially relied on to properly operate the registry.(5) The last-created string of bit gold provides the challenge bits for the next-created string.(6) To verify that Alice is the owner of a particular string of bit gold, Bob checks the unforgeable chain of title in the bit gold title registry.(7) To assay the value of a string of bit gold, Bob checks and verifies the challenge bits, the proof of work string, and the timestamp.  Note that Alice's control over her bit gold does not depend on her sole possession of the bits, but rather on her lead position in the unforgeable chain of title (chain of digital signatures) in the title registry.All of this can be automated by software.  The main limits to the security of the scheme are how well trust can be distributed in steps (3) and (4), and the problem of machine architecture which will be discussed below.Hal Finney has implemented a variant of bit gold called RPOW (Reusable Proofs of Work).  This relies on publishing the computer code for the "mint," which runs on a remote tamper-evident computer.  The purchaser of of bit gold can then use remote attestation, which Finney calls the transparent server technique, to verify that a particular number of cycles were actually performed.The main problem with all these schemes is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract "compute cycle."  (I wrote about this obscurely several years ago.)  Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold. However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven.  From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was.  Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector's items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items.  In this respect "bit gold" acts more like collector's items than like gold.  However, the match between this ex post market and the auction determining the initial value might create a very substantial profit for the "bit gold miner" who invents and deploys an optimized computer architecture.  Thus, bit gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string.  Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value.  This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible.  Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion.In summary, all money mankind has ever used has been insecure in one way or another.  This insecurity has been manifested in a wide variety of ways, from counterfeiting to theft, but the most pernicious of which has probably been inflation. Bit gold may provide us with a money of unprecedented security from these dangers.  The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address.
I am horrified by the legislation the U.S. Senate passed today. It will, short of a miracle, be signed by President Bush into law. The bill:(1) Suspends habeas corpus for all aliens, including tens of millions of aliens within the United States and its territories. This means resident aliens can be imprisoned, tortured, etc. without recourse to U.S. courts to challenge the legality of any kind of detention or treatment, no matter how despicable or illegal that treatment may be. Habeas corpus has protected the rights of all residents imprisoned in English and United States territory, by ensuring them appeal from abusive detention to the normal courts of the land, under English and United States law for over 900 (that's nine hundred) years. Habeas corpus is the wellspring of all other legal protections we have against abuse of the power to detain or imprison. For a substantial part of the U.S. population, and for all foreigners, it is now gone. (It should be noted that there has been traditionally and does need to be an exception for aliens on an actual battlefield, otherwise the ability of our military to fight would be severely compromised. But this legislation excludes all aliens from habeas protection, including the tens of millions of aliens living peacefully within or peacefully visiting the U.S.).(2) Subjects all persons, including all U.S. citizens, at the whim of the executive branch, to arbitrary detention, for indefinitely long periods of time, as "enemy combatants." Although U.S. citizens still have an appeal to normal courts via habeas corpus, the tendency of recent courts to defer to legislation over fundamental liberty rights disturbingly suggests a large free hand for the executive branch, regardless of the party of the President, here too.The vote was mostly along party lines; here are the exceptions (h/t Glenn Greenwald):Democrats in favor (12) - Carper (Del.), Johnson (S.D.), Landrieu (La.), Lautenberg (N.J.), Lieberman (Conn.), Menendez (N.J), Nelson (Fla.), Nelson (Neb.), Pryor(Ark.), Rockefeller (W. Va.), Salazar (Co.), Stabenow (Mich.).Republicans against (1) - Chafee (R.I.).Sununu (R-NH) and Specter (R-PA) tried to reverse the suspension of habeus corpus, but failing that voted for the final bill despite their objections.While the media focused attention on the more dramatic issue of what kinds of torture or inhumane treatment would be considered technically legal under the bill, for aliens this question is now moot, because, at the whim of the executive branch, they will not be able to raise the issue in front of anything but a military tribunal. And if they are not charged with any crime they will not even get a military tribunal, because the bill allows for indefinite and arbitrary detention of aliens defined, at the whim of the executive branch, as "enemy combatants."Marty Lederman also has a good description of this legislation.That this bill will be signed into law is now fait accompli. The only recourse we have now is the ballot box this fall to punish the Representatives and Senators who have surreptitiously stolen some of our most basic and hard-won freedoms.
In response to comments, for example those on Brad DeLong's blog, and otherwise due to further thinking and research, I've updated by paper on History and the Security of Property.
Bastiat versus Clinton in the battle of the candles.
Douglass North and Niall Ferguson, among other historians, have observed the dramatic lowering of English government bond rates after the Glorious Revolution in 1688 (alternatively seen as a Dutch invasion aided and abetted by Parliamentary and City of London traitors to the House of Stuart, and a subsequent "political merger" of the former enemy nations, as Ferguson puts it).  North and Ferguson have imputed these lower rates to the superiority of modern democracy which they see as having been given birth by that Revolution.   Aside from the very uncommon but verbose Jacobite, and aside from that sad majority of historians who are shallow parrots of yesterday's tabloid headlines and fail to see the importance of anything so abstract as government bond rates, there is general agreement by the remaining historians about the effect of the Revolution on the great lowering of England's bond rates.  But, while the identification of the Glorious Revolution as a great improvement in the financial condition of the English government (and subsequent world dominance of the British Empire, spread of free trade, abolition of slavery, etc. -- as well as to modern evils such as historically unprecedented rates of deficit spending, taxation, and inflation) is accurate, the attribution by North and Ferguson of these lower rates to the supposed "democratic" nature of the Revolution is quite wrong.A more accurate if rather vague view of the situation is given by Nicholas Gruen:    Be that as it may, one of the huge things that powered us into the modern world was the idea of subjecting monarchs to the rule of law - particularly in Holland and the UK (after the Glorious Revolution of 1688). Because debtors for the first time had an expectation of being repaid when the monarch borrowed money off them, bond rates went right down and the government could borrow money. ‘A free nation deep in debt’ I think was the contemporary expression as Britain and Holland’s stars rose.We can be far more specific about how the Dutch Invasion of 1688 caused England's bond rates to decrease.  There are rather three specific events, quite related to the rule of law but not at all related to voting of the masses (which was not a feature of England for more than a century following that Revolution), but far more pertinent to the English government's immediately subsequent ability to finance itself at low rates.   The first was the Bank of England.   Whatever the advantages or faults of central banking to the general economy, the Bank of England was the financial engine behind the Royal Navy's subsequent boast, factual until the 20th century, that "Britania Rules the Waves", and specifically its ability to enforce free trade and destroy slavery.   The two other events are quite related.   The second event was a now-obscure lawsuit against King William and Queen Mary resulting in a crucial legal opinion written by one of England's greatest Chief Justices, Lord Holt, in 1701.   The third was a  now-obscure provision of the 1701 Act of Settlement which reasserted the independence of Holt and the other English justices from both Crown and Parliament.   The Bank of England is well known, but these latter two events are at least as important and deserve to be yanked from their obscurity and put into every History 101 lesson.  Justice Iredell gives a good description of The Banker's Case in the later U.S. case Chisholm v. Georgia.  Briefly, in the case brought by banker creditors of the Crown in 1701 to collect in what was owed them under debts contracted by the Stuart kings, the House of Lords (the ultimate court of appeal), led by Lord Chief Justice Holt, held that that the Court of the Exchequer had the power to decide and remedy a case of debt brought against the Crown, and that their decision holding the debts valid and remedying them with payment from the Exchequer was proper.  In this particular case, William had no power to renege, not only on debts incurred under his reign, but on the debts incurred by his Stuart predecessors Charles II and James II.  This would not have meant too much of the Crown had retained a unilateral ability to fire the justices of the Court of the Exchequer for deciding against the Crown.   In the Act of Settlement Parliament determined that the Crown's justices held their posts for life "on good behavior": it would take a vote of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the concurrence of the Crown itself to impeach a justice.  The combination of The Banker's Case and judicial tenure for life created what economists call a credible commitment for the government to abide by its contracts.   This is a comitment that neither a single person as sovereign operating under Ulpian's principle of Roman law that "the prince's will is law", nor a democratic legisulature acting under Rosseau's principle that "the general will" supposedly reflected in the enactments of this legislature are unreviewable law, can make.  Such a sovereign can simply declare it to be the law that they need not abide by their contracts or by the property rights of their subjects.   It is the separation of powers -- and especially an judiciary with power of final decision over contracts involving the government treasury that is as independent as possible of those tax collectors, borrowers, and repayers -- not democratic voting that makes the credible commitment of a government to repay its debts and otherwise honor its contracts possible.
Elections create a big public choice problem.  People contribute money or other favors to candidates in exchange for political favors.  This is economically indistinguishable from bribery.  The problem with bribery is not that people can buy votes -- one can buy votes in corporations, and there's nothing corrupt about it -- but that there is a wasteful lobbying, a spending of both money and time, to purchase not votes but particular political outcomes.   Arthur contributes to Bob's election, or flies Bob around in his corporate jet, or runs some "independent" ads or news stories favorable to Bob, and Bob sends some special pork barrel goodies Arthur's  way, or gives him a special dispensation from a regulation that will hurt his competitors, or gets him a government job.   Some of the more overt forms of this election-phase bribery can be banned or minimized by law, but for every overt form there are a dozen or more subtle or novel forms that cannot effectively be regulated.Here in the U.S. the notorious McCain-Feingold law is an attempt to curb this problem.   It is notorious because it does so by restricting free speech.  In particular, it restricts who can spend how much on what kinds of speech running up to an election.   Inevitably, it and similar laws are both full of loopholes and contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of our First Amendment.There is a far better solution that does not have significant loopholes and does not regulate any speech: make elections unpredictable.  If would-be purchasers of political favors cannot predict who will win, or even who might win with substantial probability, they cannot purchase any favors prior to an election.   A perfectly unpredictable election would be bribe-free.The Grand Council Chamber in VeniceWe can't make elections perfectly unpredictable, but we can get pretty close.  There are historical and even contemporary precedents.  For example, we choose jurors by lot from a pool much larger than the twelve jurors selected.  This prevents wealthy plaintiffs, defendants, or governments from buying jurors through the selection process.  (After selection, there are a number of legal and physical sequestering mechanisms that can be used to isolate a jury from contact with favor purchasers.  As for political office, this article deals only with bribery during the selection process).  In ancient Athens, not only juries but many office-holders were selected by lot.  But the most intriguing unpredictable election process was probably that of the medieval Venetian Republic.   This republic helped turn a secure island into Europe's wealthiest trading empire.  In Venice, many political offices were selected by a repeated cycle of lottery, vote, .... lottery, vote.   The final lottery and vote, at least, were held one after the other in the same room, giving favor purchasers no time or privacy to do their business.  The leading office in Venice, the Doge, was selected by a Great Council of about 2,000 members from those members, through a process that can be diagrammed as follows:2,000 --> L30 --> L9 --> E40 --> L12 --> E25 --> L9 --> E45 --> 11L --> E41 --> ED Scott Gordon describes this process as follows:L refers here to selection by lot; E to selection by election [voting].   In the Great Council, by the drawing of balls from an urn, 30 members of the Council were selected; a further drawing reduced these to 9 who met to elect 40 men.  This 40 was reduced by lot to 12 who proceeded to elect 25, and so on until the final election selected 41 nominators, who submitted their choice to the Great Council [i.e. made the final vote for Doge]. The process is loosely similar to the confusion/defusion cycles of encryption or the repeated mixing phases used for securely anonymous Internet communications.  The Venetians alternated a randomizing step with a debate-and-voting step.  It's not clear what, if any, function was served by the particular number choices or some of the other detailed structure.    Each elector presumably had a substantial but fixed number of votes, so that there would exist a top 40, 25,  45, or 41 of vote getters despite being only 9, 12, 9, or 11 electors respectively.I suggest the following leaner structure.  A modern congressional election, for example, might look like this:600,000 voters / 100 candidates --> E23 -->  L7 --> E19 --> L11 --> E17 --> L7 --> E19 --> EMThus the top 23 vote-getters (by the 600,000 voters) are selected, from whom 7 are chosen by lot.   These lucky candidates, who now serve as electors, then elect from among all the candidates except themselves 19 electors, who are whittled down by lot to 11.   These elect 17 electors from the candidates except themselves, who are whittled down by lot to 7.   These final seven then elect 19 final electors except themselves, who proceed to elect the Representative from among all the candidates except themselves.This should probably be done online at a scheduled time, if an online election can be made secure, rather than trying to get all the elector/candidates to meet physically at one or more scheduled times.  The last two steps at least need to proceed quickly enough that no deals can be done between or during them.   With reliable connections and good user interface design it should go quite fast.   The preceeding election steps should usually include time and communications channels for debate and research, but not enough time to forge the social relationships often necessary for reliable favor purchase.I've used prime numbers based on a possibly superstitious analogy to the use of prime numbers in cryptography or by cicadas, i.e. on the hunch that prime numbers will make each step less predictable than with factorable numbers.  The process of signing up to be a candidate must be very easy, so that we can get large numbers of people signing up to run in even small elections.   The fact that they double as both electors and candidates who might get elected to office increases the motivation to become an elector/candidate.  A further benefit is that electors, themselves elected, can prevent a demagogue from being chosen, while the election cycles make it less likely than in a pure lottery for a whacko or incompetent to be chosen.
In response to this Wall Street Journal article, describing a number of scholars developing mathematical models of market bubbles, I posted the following comment at Marginal Revolution which is worth reposting here:The scholars quoted in the original article sound like they are just engaging in a fancy form of technical analysis, which purports to capture in mathematics the psychology of the crowd, but in almost all cases turns out to be worthless numerology.The fancy math doesn't explain bubbles any better than [Robert] Schiller's simple driving analogy: there is a big event at an obscure location (let's call it Burning Man, out in the middle of the desert somewhere). People driving to the event are very uncertain of the directions. At a certain intersection, on average 60% of them correctly believe they must turn right and 40% incorrectly believe they must turn left. But they can usually reduce their uncertainty by observing the behavior of others, who are somewhat more likely to be correct than wrong, and altering their [probability estimates] accordingly. Normally this works, but on rare occasions it goes wrong: for example, if the first three cars happen to turn left, the fourth, who had believed with 60% confidence that right was the proper direction, will rationally change his mind and go left. Thus a string of bad luck can make all the cars start going off in the wrong direction, except for those handful of drivers that are strongly confident in their knowledge that one should go right.Where this analogy goes off the rails as public policy analysis is with the tacit hubris that certain academics from sufficiently elite schools are flying above the whole event in a helicopter and can direct traffic, if only their mathematical analysis is fancy enough. Rather academics and policy makers are in the traffic themselves, generally seeing information biased in ways similar to or even more extreme than the information investors see and act on. In many cases mispriced markets create arbitrage opportunities for truly knowledgeable investors, but analogs to such arbitrage opportunities, i.e. the ability to be rewarded for correcting actual misinformation, are much less prevalent in academic and political policy circles. We should thus expect political policy to be much more prone to biased political fads and herd-following than markets are. Both markets and governments may often take wrong directions, but for politics the inability to correct wrong directions may be endemic. Markets tend to correct themselves, usually in the short run and practically always in the long run, depending on the costs of arbitrage, but there is often no easy way to recognize or correct a political bubble.Thus, applying the same rational uncertainty assumptions to politics as we do to markets, if we give political decisionmakers the power to "pop" bubbles they think they recognize, they will probably tend to make genuine market bubbles worse, will prevent markets from sending genuine supply and demand signals, and will introduce other extra transaction costs.
The rights of parents to control the education and upbringing of their children may be the most ancient and fundamental natural rights of all.  From modern societies to hunter-gatherer and neolithic cultures, and even back our primate ancestors, parents and, secondarily, near relatives controlled their children.  In every great civilization, parents and near relatives determined the upbringing and education of their children, with some pathological exceptions such as a ancient Sparta, Nazi Germany, and communist countries.   There was little need to do anything but take this right for granted until the rise of compulsory government education and totalitarian ideologies in the late 19th century.   In the 1920s, the Supreme Court reasserted parental rights as a common law rights in the United States in two landmark cases, Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v. Society of Sisters.  In Meyer the Court classified common law rights as falling under the substantive liberties of the Due Process Clause:  While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men...Corresponding to the right of control, it is the natural duty of the parent to give his children education suitable to their station in life...Pierce reaffirmed the the "liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control."   Most recently, "parents' fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children" was reasserted against a broad forced visitation statute in Troxel v. Granville (2000).
To get from John Rawls' "veil of ignorance" argument to his (and worse, most of his followers') favored wealth redistribution schemes requires (besides the ultimate fatal conceit that ignorant people can make rational contracts, as well as the dubious idea that we can pretend that we are ignorant of our own actual preferences) the rather extreme degree of risk aversion embodied in the "maximin" principle. As wikipedia summarizes maximin, "economic inequalities are only permitted insofar as they benefit the least well off members of society." How extreme the risk aversion this principle gives us depends on how small the group constituting the "least well of members" are...you get into strange and intractable triage hypotheticals about saving the life of one person up to the point where you'd cause the starvation of another...define your "least well off" group small enough and North Korea ends up looking like Beverly Hills in comparison to the maximin society.  Except that death in Rawlstopia would be a pleasant Kevorkian-type suicide: if anybody died a painful early death, they'd be the worst off, so we must expend all excess resources to extend their lives to whatever slight extent possible and then give them a merciful sendoff.  Others may be saved and fed only insfar as their talents are needed to attend to these worst of the worst off.  Otherwise, when the worst off go it's the Kevorkian drip for the other eaters, too.Although many academics declare their intuition agrees with being very risk averse, those intutions are not made from behind the veil of ignorance, but from their position as (usually) kids of upper middle class origins who have never had a full-time non-academic job.  Real poor people often act in a risk-seeking fashion, for example by buying lottery tickets.
I have written about how historical forms of political and legal structures have depended on needs to secure property. Recently scholars and writers ranging from Michael L. Ross to Thomas Friedman have pointed out how oil revenue tends to vary inversely with democracy and freedom. Their main theory for this is that oil revenues allow governments to boost their own power and protect themselves from irate citizens. This is particuarly the case when oil prices are high, as now, whereas lower oil prices tend to decrease government power and encourage freedom. Taxing citizens or their more diffuse property directly tends to encourage democracy movements, but pricy oil allows despotisms in today's Venezuala, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and elsewhere to avoid depending overly on such diffuse taxes for their power. (Historically, democracy tended to emerge, for example in England, by the need for kings to get the "consent" of the realm via Parliament to tax internal property).What these scholars tend not to have focused on, however, is why governments derive so much revenue and power from oil as opposed to manufactured goods, information, or services. The answer lies in the legal uncertanties and the physical insecurity of investments in oil relative to other kinds of taxable property. Private property rights in oil have tended to be problematic, because of the novelty of the industry, because these legal structures were created during an era (early 20th century) when private property was unpopular in most legal circles, and because of the large ratio of initial capital investment to subsequent operating costs needed to extract the oil.All mineral rights give rise to legal problems, due to the interferences (externalities) that occur between mineral rights and rights in the overlying land. Mineral investments tend to be insecure because of the large ratio of initial capital investment in discovery and development to subsequent operating costs. In other words, once the exploration companies do the hard work, it is easy for whoever has the political or military power to come along and steal the benefits. This ratio is far larger for oil in particular than for the farmland which we have seen historically was very dependent on large scale militiaries for protection, and it is high for minerals generally. Once most kinds of minerals, and especially oil, are found, they are far more vulnerable than other kinds of property to political appropriation. Legal uncertainties and the nationalist and socialist traditions surrounding oil encourage this in particular for oil. As a result, most oil deposits around the globe have been nationalized, and even where they have not been nationalized their extraction is usually subject to steep taxation. Michael L. Ross has shown that the inverse relationship between oil and indicia of freedom is "valid and statistically robust" and extends to states rich in other kinds of minerals, which share the large ratio of initial capital investment in discovery and development to subsequent operating costs. The security needs of oil and other mineral property, combined with the unwillingess of governments providing that security to forego the revenue windfall (for example by privatizing oil fields and not steeply taxing them), explains why this is so.
Chief Justice Roberts has recused himself from Metabolite, so there will be eight justices deciding the case including Stevens.  Here is the schedule:Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories, Inc., Supreme Court No. 04-607: Briefing schedule through January 2005; hearing February-April 2006; decision by June 2006.Although the case may be decided on narrower grounds, it's possible that this case could have profound implications for software and business method patents, especially if Justice Stevens' methodology in the 1978 case Parker v. Flook is applied here.   I describe a clarified version of this methodology in a paper on the origin of U.S. software patents I wrote earlier this year.   Here is a brief summary of that methodology and of Metabolite.
The oxygen crisis in the history of life is well known.   When photosynthesis arose, cyanobacteria and later plants started dumping large amounts of oxygen into earth’s atmosphere.   At first this oxygen, dissolved in the oceans, combined with metals in the oceans and “rusted out.”   Eventually, however, the free metals in the oceans were largely depleted and oxygen levels increased in the atmosphere.   At first this proved very poisonous, but eventually life not only adapted but took advantage of the oxygen, with some organisms evolving new high-energy respiration pathways that reacted oxygen with carbohydrates from eaten plants.  Respiration fueled the Cambrian explosion of sophisticated lifeforms which in turn led to us.Much less well known, but of similar importance, was the much earlier nitrogen crisis.   This was not an overabundance of nitrogen, but the depletion of nitrogen in the readily usable forms that early life had evolved to consume. One might think that life would evolve to reflect at least roughly the same distribution of elements as are available in its environment.   Let’s see if this true relative to abundance in our planet’s present oceans:Elemental abundance in bacteria vs. in seawater (ref):This is misleading for the metals before the oxygen crisis (i.e. for most of the history of life), when they were far more abundant in the oceans than the present levels shown.   But for elements that did not “rust out” of oxygenated seawater, such as oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, the above graph is illuminating.There is a great deal of correlation here to be sure, but there are also outliers, elements that life must concentrate by several orders of magnitude: particularly carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous, and to a lesser extent potassium.   A reasonable guess is that this reflects contingency: life originated in a certain unusual environment, an environment disproportionately rich in certain chemicals, and its core functions cannot evolve to be based on any other molecules.  Every known living thing requires, in its core functions, nucleic acids (which make up RNA and DNA), amino acids (which make up proteins, including the crucial proteins that catalyze chemical reactions called enzymes), and the “energy currency” though which all metabolisms consume and produce energy, the adenosine phosphates.   Let’s briefly scan some core biological molecules to see how elements are distributed in them:Adenosine phosphates:Nucleic acid:Amino acids:Lots of hydrogen and oxygen in these molecules, to be sure, but those are the elements in water.   So short of a drought or desert, organisms generally have plenty of readily accessible hydrogen and oxygen.   Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous – those are the elements most used by the core molecules of life out of proportion to their existence in the environment.Carbon, as carbon dioxide, is abundant in the atmosphere (and earlier in earth’s history was far more abundant still).    Through the process of photosynthesis, the two double bonds in carbon dioxide can be readily cleaved in order to form other bonds with the carbon in biological molecules.  Indeed, instead of storing energy directly as ATP, life can and does take advantage of the relative accessibility of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen to store energy as carbohydrates and fats, and then through respiration convert them to ATP only when needed.Nitrogen is also abundant in earth’s atmosphere, but in the form of dinitrogen – two nitrogens superglued together with an ultra-strong triple bond.   To form nucleic acids, amino acids, and ATP, something must crack apart the nitrogen.  Phosphorous, to the extent it is available in the natural environment, comes in the readily incorporated form of phosphates.   The trouble is, phosphorous in any form is just plain uncommon.   Nevertheless, all life still relies on it at the center of the genetic code (DNA, RNA) and every metabolism (ATP).Generally speaking, the result of the chemical contingencies of known life – which for its core functions uses molecules rich in hard-to-obtain nitrogen and phosphorous -- is that in known natural environments ecosystems are either nitrogen-limited or phosphorous-limited.    In other worse, the biomass of the ecosystem is usually limited by the amount of nitrogen or phosphorous available.   Liebig’s principle states that in any given environment, there is generally one nutrient that limits the growth of an organism or ecosystem.  In earth environments that nutrient is usually nitrogen (as ammonia or nitrate) or phosphorous (as phosphate).The eukaryotes (basically, complicated multi-celled life including all plants, animals and fungi) seem to lack the ability to evolve metabolisms that go beyond a certain point.   Instead it’s the simpler prokaryotes -- archae and bacteria -- that have a far wider range of energy chemistry: a dizzying variety of chemosynthetic and photosynthetic metabolisms and ecosystems. For certain crucial chemicals, the eukaryotes rely on archae and bacteria in their ecosystem.   Exhibit A is nitrogen fixation.  Life doubtless originated in an environment rich in ammonia and/or nitrates, molecules with only single nitrogens and thus no need to split the superglued dinitrogen bond.   But these early organisms would have soon depleted the levels of nitrates and ammonia in the local environment to very low levels.    Call it the nitrogen crisis.Dinitrogen, N2, is the most abundant molecule in our atmosphere.  But  few things are powerful or precise enough to crack dinitrogen.   Lightning can do it, converting dinitrogen and dioxygen in the earth’s atmosphere into nitrates.   Lightning thus can, albeit very slowly, put usable nitrates back into sea and soil where they have been depleted by life.   Trouble is (a) the resulting equilibrium level is far below the concentrations of nitrogen in organisms, and far below levels for optimum growth, and (b) the process requires an atmosphere rich in oxygen, which the earth until less than a billion years ago did not possess.  (Alternatively, lightning might have made significant nitrates from reacting carbon dioxide with nitrogen, a possibility explored here.  However, early life probably evolved in water so hot that it destroyed these nitrates).Prokaryotes came to the rescue – probably very early in the history of life, when local nitrates and ammonia had been exhausted – by evolving perhaps the most important enzyme in biology, nitrogenase, “the nitrogen-splitting anvil.”   Nitrogenase’s metal-sulfur core makes it precise enough a catalyst to crack the triple bond of dinitrogen.  Nitrogenase:The general  reaction fixing dinitrogen to ammonia, whether with nitrogenase or artificially, is as follows:N2 + 6 H + energy → 2 NH3The dinitrogen is split and combined with hydrogen to form ammonia.  Ammonia can then be readily used as an ingredient that ends up, via the sophisticated metabolism that exists in all life, as amino acids, nucleic acids, and adenosine phosphates.  When nitrogenase fixes nitrogen it consumes a prodigious amount of energy in the form of ATP.  In particular for each atom of nitrogen it consumes the energy of 8 phosphate bonds: N2 + 8 H+ + 8 e− + 16 ATP → 2 NH3 + H2 + 16 ADP + 16 PNitrogenase is extremely similar all organisms known to contain it.   It thus probably only ever evolved once.   Given its crucial function of supplying a limiting nutrient, despite its high energy cost it proved to be so useful that it spread to many phyla of archae and bacteria.  Either it evolved very early in the history of life (before the “LCA”, the Last Common Ancestor of all known life) or it spread through horizontal gene transmission:Alternative origins and evolution of nitrogenase (click to enlarge) ( ref):The archae and bacteria that contain nitrogenase, and can thus fix nitrogen, are called diazotrophs.  One of the earliest diazotrophs may have been a critter that, like this one, lived in high pressure hot water in an undersea vent.  In today’s ocean, the most common diazotroph is the phytoplankton Trichodesmium.  Colonies of Trichodesmium:The biomass earth's oceans is probably limited by the population of such diazotrophs.  Supplying the iron they use to make nitrogenase would increase the amount of nitrogen fixation and thus the biomass in the oceans.    A larger ocean ecosystem would draw out more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and so is of great interest.   This process in the ocean seems to have its limits, however: too much ocean biomass in a particular area can, when it decomposes, deplete oxygen from the ocean, suffocating animals.   Oxygen replacement from the atmosphere appears to be too slow to prevent this effect when nitrogen concentrations are high enough, but nitrogen concentrations in almost all ocean areas are far lower than this and would remain lower even while drawing out substantial amounts of carbon dioxide.   (Here is a nice Flash animation of the nitrogen cycle in the oceans).On land, certain plants, especially legumes, are symbiotic with certain diazotrophs.   The bugs grow in root nodules in which the legume supplies them large amounts of sugar to power the energy-greedy nitrogenase.  In turn, the diazotrophs supply their legume hosts with fixed nitrogen allowing the legumes to generate more protein more quickly than other plants: but at the expense of more photosynthesis needed to feed the energy-hungry bugs.
Two professors here at GWU, Orin Kerr and Daniel Solove have written on the legality of the President authorizing the ultra-secretive National Security Agency (NSA) to spy on U.S. citizens without getting warrants from the FISA court.  For further updates check Volokh Conspiracy and Emergent Chaos.For the President to authorize the NSA to bypass the courts and spy on citizens without a warrant is very dangerous and very illegal.  We have spent most of the last century expending hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars to fight against dictatorships, and now we are accelerating down the entrance ramp to unchecked executive power ourselves.The Justice Department argues that the President has what amounts to arbitrary powers in times of war or emergency.  Here is some of what the founders of the United States wrote that flies in the face of the Justice Department's view of the law.  What the founders wrote in our Constitution is, despite what the Justice Department, Bush, and Gonzales say, still the law of the land:Article I gives Congress "all legislative power" including the right to declare war and "[t]o make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces."  Congress is entrusted with the basic war-making powers.   It may through specific legislation instruct the executive branch, and the executive must "faithfully execute" these laws (Article II).  To not faithfully execute the FISA statute that requires a court warrant for a wiretap, for example, is an impeachable offense against the Constitution.  To fail to faithfully execute the Fourth Amendment, which requires a court warrant for conducting any search, is an impeachable offense against the Constitution."All legislative powers" means these powers are inalienable: Congress may not grant them wholesale to the executive branch.  Congress could thus not in its 2001 war authorization instructing the President to use "all necessary and appropriate force" have thereby given the President powers arbitrarily to spy on United States citizens communicating overseas -- even if that is what Congress intended, which is highly doubtful.  Rather, the President's powers to spy remain defined by the Congressional acts which specified FISA,including the PATRIOT Act.  These acts (like the Constitution itself) require the executive branch -- that includes the NSA as well as the FBI and every other such agency -- to obtain a court warrant before spying on the communications of U.S. citizens, whether that communication is directed overseas or is purely domestic.The very lame "process" of the President notifying a handful of House and Senate leaders about the existence of some vague wiretapping program, which cannot be further elucidated "for national security reasons," is no sort of effective check and balance and thus, not surprisingly, is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.  Furthermore, the Fourth Amendment to that Constitution expressly forbids searches and seizures without a court warrant, even if the Congress and the Executive both approve.  The utter necessity of checks and balances is well illustrated by what one of the main drafters of our Constitution, James Madison, said about them in Federalist #10. Madison thought that government, the ultimate in trusted third parties, should not be based on an actual particular party: “ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the rights of the place," and thus "it is necessary...to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as each may be a check on the other – that the private interests of every individual may be a sentinel on the public rights.”President Reagan advised us when it came to dealing with power to "trust but verify."  Madison too fought to protect the United States against dictatorship.  If we are wise, we will follow the Constitution and protect ourselves from dictatorship as well.  As another of our law professors, Jonathan Turley, has stated, the NSA by spying on American citizens without warrants is committing felonies, and the President by authorizing these acts is committing felonies.  By law, the President ought to be impeached by the House, convicted by the Senate, and thus thrown from office.  Furtheremore, those conducting these wiretaps at the NSA are felons who must under law be fired, prosecuted, and imprisoned.But while we are "at war" (with Iraq, terrorists, drugs, and so on) a large portion of the populace, including talk radio demagogues and most of the current Republicans in Congress (with a few refreshing exceptions such as Senator Sununu) genuflect to the alpha male as if he were God and to top secret agencies as if they were God's messengers.  Impeachment by a Republican House and Senate?  Fat chance.  Dream on.Furthermore, impeachment and removal of Bush, would, however strongly it is compelled by the law, only address the latest symptoms, not the disease.  What is really required is a rebirth of learning about the our Constitution and a reformation of the Justice Department and our attitudes towards it.What the President and the NSA are doing is blatantly illegal in the opinion of practically every legal scholar knowledgeable about the original meaning of our Constitution, and indeed in the opinion of most legal scholars of any philosophical stripe outside of the Justice Department.  Over the years the Justice Department has developed its own unique view of the world in which the executive branch "in times of emergency" (which could mean just about any time) has the arbitrary powers of a dictator.  Indeed, the Justice Department has been arguing, often with success, for the doctrine that the executive has arbitrary emergency and wartime powers long before George W. Bush (and even long before George H.W. Bush).  The Justice Department has thus given lip service to "rule of law" while slowly scratching actual rule of law and the Constitution to shreds.  George Bush and Alberto Gonzales are merely the latest mouthpieces of a Justice Department that has been destroying what the founders fought for in 1776 and debated and ratified in 1789 -- protection against unchecked government.  We must thus reform the Justice Department and our attitudes towards that Department.  The Supreme Court should never treat Justice Department as a source of legal authority.  It should impute to their briefs no more credibility than it imputes to anybody's else's brief.  The Justice Department is just another party with an interest -- except that this interest happens to be aggrandizing to the executive branch arbitrary power over which the only remaining legal check is the Justice Department itself.This is the Christmas season here in the United States, a season of the story of when God came down to Earth as the baby Jesus and angels sang about Peace on Earth.  If we were ruled by God on earth, we would not need separation of powers with checks and balances.  Madison wrote, "[i]f men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls would be necessary.”  But we are not ruled by an omniscient and omni-beneficent deity, nor by angels: we are ruled by George Bush as advised by a Justice Department that has forgotten what the Constitution means.  The Christmas infant when he grew up said to "render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar, and unto God the things that are God's."  Our Caesar is, like the Caesars of old, trying to aggrandize himself with powers that could only wisely be entrusted to an all-beneficient God.  We thus need separation of powers and checks and balances more than ever.  And we need the Justice Department to stop aggrandizing power to itself by misleading the President and the American people about the United States Constitution.  There might be an excuse of naive reliance on bad advice to forgive the President for making the claims he is making, but professional lawyers entrusted with enforcing the federal laws should know better.
The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) governed Iraq between April 2003 and June 2004. Despite the governmental powers it wielded, its legal nature is "shrouded in ambiguity," according to federal district court Judge T.S. Ellis III. This Congressional Report concurs.The issue made it to court due to a lawsuit against various CPA contractors. The issue was whether the CPA was a U.S. federal agency, and thus the CPA's contractors federal government contractors. Judge Ellis held that the plaintiffs could not prove that they were. (Incidentally, some of these contractors, such as Custer Battles LLC, are also interesting entities: private companies apparently wielding some governmental and military powers delegated from the CPA. But that will have to be a subject for another time. First we have to figure out what the authority was that CPA had to grant).Was the CPA created by President Bush as a separate federal agency in a National Security Directive? Was it a division of the United States Department of Defense as the Department of Justice now argues? Was it a United Nations agency created pursuant to a U.N. Security Council directive? Was it as Paul Krugman calls it a "private fiefdom"? Was it a private contractor wielding today's version of the colonial franchise? Was it a government created by a secret charter? (Imagine if the U.S. Constitution was a state secret. I can't do it, but let's try). Or -- most likely of all -- was it simply an ad-hoc creation based on no good legal procedure whatsoever? According to Judge Ellis, "....there is no formal document – whether statute, United Nations Security Council resolution, or other organic document – that plainly establishes the CPA or provides for its formation." The Congressional report agrees: " Detailed information that explicitly and clearly identifies how CPA was established, by whom, and under what specific authority, is not readily available."The CPA's direct predecessor in governing Iraq was the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA). The ORHA is the product of the still-classified National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 24 in January 2003. Its first head, retired Lieutenant General Jay Garner, was apparently hired by the Secretary Defense. A news story stated that he would report to the commander of the U.S. Central Command, who was at the time General Tommy Franks. But Garner's position description stated:This Office [ORHA] is established at the direction of the President of the United States, and is located for administrative purposes under Boards, Commissions and Task Forces, Washington Headquarters Services. This Office is under the supervision of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.Garner's tenure was short-lived as the OHRA was within two months replaced by the CPA:On May 13, 2003, the Secretary of Defense designated Ambassador Bremer as CPA Administrator. The first regulation issued by Ambassador Bremer, dated May 16, 2003, identified him as Administrator of CPA. The authority’s Inspector General (IG) stated, in his initial report to Congress, that OHRA became CPA in May 2003. However, a March 2004 DOD IG report stated that the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in a June 16, 2003, memorandum, dissolved ORHA and shifted ORHA’s functions, responsibilities, and legal obligations to CPA.The senior officials of the CPA were various active and retired U.S. military officers, U.S. ambassadors, and a liason from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).NPSD 36 in May 2004 retroactively defined the CPA as a "temporary organization" under 5 U.S.C. § 3161. But it is still unknown under what "law or Executive order," if any, the CPA was established so as to qualify as a "temporary organization."In a report to Congress the Office of Management and Budget stated the following:The Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) reports to the President through the Secretary of Defense. He oversees, directs and coordinates all U.S. Government (USG) programs and activities in Iraq, except those under the command of the Commander, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)... The CPA is vested by the President with all executive, legislative and judicial authority [i.e. governmental power] necessary to achieve its objectives, exercised consistent with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, including [U.N. Security Council] Resolution 1483,32 and the laws and usages of war. The CPA Administrator has primary responsibility for exercising this authority."The CPA is vested by the President with all executive, legislative, and judicial authority..." sounds very much like the language of Britain's colonial charters. But it subsitutes "vest" for "grant" (I'm not sure what thelegal implication of that might be) and lacks anything like the very redeeming feature of the American colonial charters that reserved rights to their "English liberties" for the residents of the granted area -- one of the main origins of the United States' Bill of Rights. Only the "laws and usages of war" seem to have restricted the CPA under the charter language reported here. This is more like the charter of the Royal Guinea Company that granted said corporation martial law power so that the company would have a free hand to defend its taking of slaves. To be fair, the United States was fighting a war, and the CPA unlike the Guinea Company was temporary and not, as far as I know, taking slaves.Under the principle of conservation of rights, the President could not grant any more authority than he himself possessed under law. But that's an interesting side issue.If indeed the Adminstrator of the CPA "reports to" the Secretary of Defense, this suggests a principle-agent or employment relationship rather than a property relationhip (the owner of one property does not "report to" another). So that rules out a true private franchise (or, as Paul Krugman crudely and naively puts it in today's New York Times, a "private fiefdom") as a theory. Thus it wasn't as independent as the typical British colonial corporation. That doesn't rule out some other kind of contracting relationship, however, or just a DoD internal hierarchy, either of which could be at least as or more corrupt than a so-called "fiefdom." There was never any such legal entity as a "fiefdom," by the way -- the term is a figment of non-legal historians' imaginations and of uncritical readers of history like Paul Krugman.Of course the Brits, still playing Empire, chimed in to say that they, too, helped set up the CPA in this letter to the United Nations:In order to meet these objectives and obligations [disarming Iraq and providing for the humanitarian needs of Iraqis] in the post-conflict period in Iraq, the United States, the United Kingdom and Coalition partners, acting under existing command and control arrangements through the Commander of Coalition Forces, have created the Coalition Provisional Authority, which includes the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, to exercise powers of government temporarily, and, as necessary, especially to provide security, to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid, and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.The CPA's status was also a matter of PR:Billing itself as an international coalition, while eschewing the label “federal agency,” might be construed as an effort to make the organization more palatable, at least symbolically, to Iraqis and others. For example, the CPA website address ended “.com” and the PMO website ended “.net.” United States government website addresses typically end “.gov.” Furthermore, the Iraqi flag is the only flag that appeared on the two websites. No flags from coalition countries were displayed.Of course Congress' biggest concern of isFurther compounding the problem, oversight initiatives might have been met with theresponse that the activity in question was carried out under an authority over which the oversight body — Congress — had no jurisdiction. Shades of Parliament declaring oversight authority over the American Colonies? (That was the main legal issue of the American Revolution, I hope my U.S. readers recall). It's better than the leading alternatives of unaccountable Presidential authority or United Nations authority, I suppose. And unlike Parliament's claim it is presumably like the CPA a temporary one.The Congressional report concludes that "[t]he status of this organization remains open to question." It suggests that the CPA has a "capacity as an entity of the United State government" but that it also had "other roles." That means that the CPA was able to operate with more flexibility and less accountability: "[p]ossibly, the mix of arrangements allowed CPA to operate with greater discretion and more authority, and have access to more resources, than if it had been solely a federal agency, or an arm of the United Nations."Available information about the authority found in materials produced by the Administration alternatively (1) denies that it was a federal agency; (2) states that it was a U.S. government entity or instrumentality; (3) suggests that it was enacted under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483; (4) refers to it, and OHRA, as “civilian groups ... reporting to the Secretary [of Defense]”;143 (5) states that it was created by the United States and United Kingdom; and (6) asserts that it was established by the then-Commander of CENTCOM. Without a clear, unambiguous statement that declares the CPA’s organizational status, clarifies what its relationship was with DOD and other federal agencies, and addresses the competing explanations for how it was created, various questions are left unanswered, including whether, and to what extent, CPA might be held accountable for its programs, activities, decisions, and expenditures.I couldn't agree more. But I'd add the following: bureaucratic hierarchy is not the be-all and end-all of government, nor is Congressional oversight, especially when the people being governed (here the Iraqis) are not voting for said Congress. (No taxation without representation, remember?) Just as the printing press era led to substantial reorganization and the rise of bureacracy, so the era of Internet consciousness and asymmetric warfare may lead to the rise of new, and the recreation of the best of old, alternatives to a command-and-control bureaucracy for basic governmental functions. Franchise government -- the colonial corporation and its subsets -- probably has a valuable role to play if we insist on conducting "democracy building" operations overseas. The crude recapiulation of this form (alas, sans most of the legal protections that historically accompanied it) in the form of the CPA and its contractors suggests that the franchise form is indeed re-emerging.Democracy spread to America, not in the form of a central government bureacracy, and certainly not in the form of a military authority, but in the form of colonial companies whose charters preserved for residents our "English liberties." If we use franchises, however, we need to use them openly, and we need to revive the limitations we imposed on them -- especially the ability of victims of their abuses to sue in royal courts (for the U.S. that would be federal courts), especially for violations of the kinds of procedural rights now found in the U.S. Bill of Rights and the international Geneva Conventions regarding war.Meanwhile, we should have no secret charters. How much freedom would we have under the U.S. Constitution if it were secret? How well would our "English liberties" have been preserved in the American colonies, and the institutions of democracy developed, if our charters had been secret? How accountable would such a government be? NPSD 24 should be declassified immediately, and no secret charter should be considered to have any legal authority by any government official or any other citizen any time in the future.
Peter Calveley has succeeded in getting the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to throw out most of the claims in Amazon's infamous one-click patent, including the broadest claims.  Amazon now has an opportunity to respond and convince the USPTO to change its mind, but its prospects are dim.   From Peter's report:In a recent office action, the USPTO has rejected the claims of the Amazon.com one-click patent following the re-examination request that I filed on 16 February 2006. My review resulted in the broadest claims of the patent being ruled invalid.In its Office Action released 9 October 2007, the Patent Office found that the prior art I found and submitted completely anticipated the broadest claims of the patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,960,411.I had only requested the USPTO look at claims 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21 and 22 but the Office Action rejects claims 11-26 and claims 1-5 as well!I reported on this soon after it got started and am proud to have assisted Peter in this endeavor.   Here is Peter's full report.
The history of the Due Process Clause in the United States' Constitution, and how it came to cover everything from (at various points in U.S. history) freedom of contract to abortion, is a long story which I should tell some day, but here is a very short version. It starts with the idea of a "common law" or "due process" -- synonyms in late medieval and Renaissance English law. Then these phrases meant not substantive judge-made law (as "common law" means today) but a group of procedural rights and principles which courts had slowly developed through precedent and that all royal courts in England (even to some extent privately owned courts) were expected to respect. One of these basic due process principles was that a court could not "take property from A and give it to B" except as a remedy for a wrong done by A to B.  The Due Process Clause of the 5th and 14th Amendments -- "no deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due proces of law" -- was meant as a reference to these basic rights and principles, as well as to the continuing precedential development of such rights and principles by courts.The basic idea behind the Lochner line of cases was that minimum wage laws, maximum hour laws, and such were taking property from one group (e.g. capital) and giving to another (e.g. labor) even though the one group had done the other no adjudicated wrong. But since many government laws even in the 19th century did redistribute rights people value from one class to another like this, this way of applying due process principles was too broad an attack on statutory sovereignty and practical politics to work without some compromises.But it was too late to discover such compromises throught the slow process deciding disputes and discovering rules, before being swamped by the tide of Progressive statutory sovereignty. The Lochner line of cases quickly became hedged about and mutated: the principle involved was later said to be freedom of contract (both an employer's and a worker's rights were violated by such laws, rather than the problem being a redistribution without a wrong), and it was held (even before the New Deal) that a government merely had to come up with a "rational basis" to justify taking in this loose sense from group A to give to group B, etc.After Footnote Four, "merely economic" rights like property were derogated -- it became trivial for government to "prove" a "rational basis."  So we now find "rational basis" applied to most kinds o f rights while an "important/compelling governmental interest" is applied to important personal and political rights like contraception, abortion, free speech, voting, interstate travel, etc. (BTW, that U.S. courts find interstate travel to be a fundamental right is very interesting in light of the importance of low exit costs in fostering healthy legal and political competition).The "rational basis" test is the state of Lochner precedent today -- a trivial test that "merely economic" laws practically always pass, in contrast to the "rationality-with-teeth" of personal rights cases like Lawrence v. Texas.   Nominally, however, the test of Lawrence is the same as the test of Lochner, and both are good law, so that it takes only a court sympathetic with property rights to revive Lochner.Such a development may take the form of an elephant that is in the room of modern due process cases -- freedom of contract.   Implicit in Griswold, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and many other such cases is not only a personal right, but a freedom of contract that is quite necessarily associated with this personal right.   Without freedom to contract with an abortion provider,  the right of a woman to get an abortion would be unduly burdened.   Only this can explain why a contraception clinic is able to sue for a right to vend, not merely use, contraception, and Planned Parenthood is able to sue for a right to provide abortion services, not merely for a right of a woman to have an abortion.The same is true for almost any other fundamental right.   Our crucial right of interstate travel, for example, must involve to at least some extent the freedom to contract with an airline company (buy a plane ticket and travel), to purchase a motor vehicle, to contract with a car rental company, and so on.   This being the case, our courts should recognize that freedom of contract is not "merely" an "economic right."  It is also a basic political right.  Our courts should recognize a general freedom of contract, which becomes a fundamental right if it involves a contracting about a fundamental right, whether that be buying condoms (Griswold v. Conneticutt) or sending our children to private schools (Pierce v. Society of Sisters).
Some development economists such as Hernando de Soto and Craig Richardson have stressed the crucial role of property rights in building wealth within and developing beyond an agricultural economy.  In particular they emphasize the importance of recorded titles that allow property to be reliably pledged as collateral.  In the above reference Craig Richardson reports in particular about how the recent deprivation of property rights in Zimbabwe led to the collapse of that economy.  His statistical analysis eliminates substantial contributions from other hypothesized causes of that collapse, such as the minor drought.  Richardson cites the observations of contemporaries that despite the drought, dams in Zimbabwe remained full.  Irrigated farmlands had not been planted and fertilized properly in the first place and irrigation equipment had often been looted.  Richardson traces these symptoms to the lack of incentives to properly raise crops and lack of seasonal loans to fund planting, fertilization, and irrigation, both consequent of uncertain property titles.The importance for development of being able to use property as collateral is confirmed by Western Europe's own experience, starting in the late medieval era, in developing wealth within the agricultural economy and using agricultural wealth to finance ventures beyond agriculture.  During this period Western Europe, and in particular the city-states of Italy, developed a wide variety of new kinds of contracts that provided the legal foundations for business ventures, loans, insurance, and a wide variety of other structures.  Insurance, for example, enabled Europeans to mount unprecedented overseas ventures of trading an empire-building.  In de Soto's terminology, Western Europe coverted "dead capital" of agricultural land and other fixed wealth into the "live capital" of manufacturing and overseas ventures.Many of these contracts were based on collateral clauses.  For example, commenda contracts allowed an investor (who was "sleeping," like a creditor, and thus had limited liability like a creditor, but unlike a creditor would be paid a share of profits) to fund the purchase of ships and goods and other financing of trading voyages.  As early as 1073, the recipient of a commenda investment pledged "if I do not observe everything just as is stated above, I, together with my heirs, then promise to give and to return to you and your heirs everything in the double, both capital and profit, [i.e. the capital and profit plus again as much as a penalty], out of my land and my house or out of anything I am known to have in this world."   Simimlarly other kinds of business venture investments, loans, insurance, and a wide variety of other contracts used in the Italian city-states were usually underpinned by pledges of land, goods, or both.During the late Middle Ages Europeans cities started developing municipal records for recording these "security interests" in land and chattels.  These allowed future creditors to check and see whether goods or real estate were already pledged.  Along with these developments came the commercial innovations that made the industrial revolution and subsequent wealth of the West possible. In our era a wide variety of kinds of property would benefit from distributed property title databases that reduce dependence on particular government offices for the security of property titles.Image: Instruments for surveying property boundaries, from ancient Rome.

In an article most Americans (not including me) will find outrageous, but many international legal scholars and overseas judges will not, Scott Horton argues that U.S. Justice Department lawyers who advised executive officers that acts such as "extraordinary rendition," waterboarding, and so on were legal, when they should have known that they were war crimes, can and should themselves be prosecuted overseas for war crimes, along with the officers who ordered or carried out the alleged war crimes. I have previously discussed how many lawyers in and the bureaucratic culture of the Justice Department, and not just the current President, are morally responsible for the expansions of power, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and international law, that have occurred in the U.S. executive branch in former as well as recent years. Now Horton argues that these lawyers can also be held legally responsible for war crimes under international criminal law when they advised, having actual or constructive knowledge to the contrary, that those criminal acts were legal.Horton starts with a premise that should be self-evident: "In a proper society, the lawyers are the guardians of law, and in times of war, their role becomes solemn." Horton cites the Nuremburg war crimes case United States v. Altstoetter. German Justice Department lawyers had drafted detailed regulations implementing commander-in-chief Adolf Hitler's "Night and Fog" (Nacht- und Nebelerlass) decree which authorized secret detentions, i.e. "disappearing" or "extraordinary rendition" in wartime, a violation of the Hague Conventions:The [German] Justice Department lawyers were indicted and charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes arising out of the issuance and implementation of the Nacht- und Nebelerlass. The United States charged that as lawyers, "not farmers or factory workers," they must have recognized that their technical justifications for avoiding the application of the Hague and Geneva Conventions were unavailing, because these conventions were "recognized by all civilized nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war." That is to say, they were customary international law. Further, the United States charged, this decree "would probably cause the death of human beings," grounding a charge of homicidal intent.After trial, the two principal Justice Department lawyers, one a deputy chief of the criminal division, were convicted and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, less time served. This judgment clearly established the concept of liability of the authors of bureaucratic policies that breach basic rules of the Hague and Geneva Conventions for the consequences that predictably flow therefrom. Moreover, it establishes a particularly perilous standard of liability for government attorneys who adopt a dismissive attitude towards international humanitarian law. Horton also makes the interesting observation that Military Commissions Act, recently passed in the U.S., by so clearly preventing prosecutions within the U.S. for violations of international law, makes the assertion of overseas jurisdiction against U.S. citizens far more clearly legal in "universal jurisdiction" countries. Of course, practical politics will almost surely prevent overseas courts from exerting coercive process over employees of the world' s sole superpower, but it's nevertheless a quite interesting argument:Clearly there will be no prosecutions in the US, certainly not under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who would figure near the top of anyone's list of criminal conspirators and whose name has already appeared in a criminal indictment relating to Abu Ghraib. But what about universal jurisdiction processes? Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy all have universal jurisdiction statutes. Germany has already entertained a complaint against Rumsfeld, Tenet and others over detainee abuse questions. That complaint was dismissed without prejudice by the German Federal Prosecutor. In his opinion, the Federal Prosecutor stated that the first predicate of the statute had not been met since there was no showing that a prosecution for the crimes shown in the home nation of the defendants would not occur. Considering the political and military position of the United States, the invocation of a universal jurisdiction statute against sitting officers of the government has to be viewed as more than an uphill task. But I think passage of the [U.S. Military Commissions] Act has just made it a whole lot easier.Reaching U.S. citizens with coercive process could be very difficult. But these universal jurisdiction countries could establish a war criminal suspect watch list for use in their airports, just as we have terrorist watch lists. Many Justice Department lawyers could then find themselves sadly limited in their vacation itineraries.
A group of U.S.-based professionals who often communicate overseas has sued the U.S. National Security Agency, observing that their professional communications and other free speech have been chilled by illegal NSA surveillance and that their Fourth Amendment rights to speak privately with clients, sources, and so on have been violated.  Here is their complaint to the U.S. federal court.   The plaintiffs say they "have a well-founded belief that their communications are being intercepted" by the NSA's illegal surveillance of domestic-overseas communications.  The NSA's program is "is disrupting the ability of the plaintiffs to talk with sources, locate witnesses, conduct scholarship, and engage in advocacy," and thus the NSA is "seriously compromising the free speech and privacy rights of the plaintiffs and others" in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments and the separation of powers.  I have explained why the NSA domestic-overseas surveillance program violates the Fourth Amendment and separation of powers here.  I look forward to reading the plaintiffs' arguments for their free speech and association claims.The lead plaintiff is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  Among the plaintiffs is James Bamford, author of The Puzzle Palace and Body of Secrets, perhaps the best books written about the NSA.  It will be interesting to see U.S. discovery rules (among the most intrusive in the world) pitted against U.S. national security secrecy rules (among the most paranoid in the world).The complaint has some spelling errors and typos, suggesting that it was rather quickly thrown together.  Here are the plaintiffs' Causes of Action and Prayer for Relief:CAUSES OF ACTION192. The Program violates plaintiffs’ free speech and associational rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.193. The Program violates plaintiffs’ privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.194. The Program violates the principle of separation of powers because it was authorized by President Bush in excess of his Executive authority under Article II of the United States Constitution and is contrary to limits imposed by Congress. 195. The Program violates the Administrative Procedures Act because the NSA’s actions under the Program exceed statutory authority and limitations imposed by Congress through FISA and Title III; are not otherwise in accordance with law; are contrary to constitutional right; and are taken without observance of procedures required by law.PRAYER FOR RELIEFWHEREFORE plaintiffs respectfully requests[sic] that the Court:1. Declare that the Program is unconstitutional under the First and Fourth Amendments;2. Declare that the Program violates the principle of separation of powers;2.[sic] Declare that the Program violates the Administrative Procedures Act;3. Permanently enjoin defendants from utilizing the Program;4. Award Plaintiff fees and costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412;5. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
When we currently use a smart phone or a laptop on a cell network or the Internet, the other end of these interactions typically run on other solo computers, such as web servers. Practically all of these machines have architectures that were designed to be controlled by a single person or a hierarchy of people who know and trust each other. From the point of view of a remote web or app user, these architectures are based on full trust in an unknown "root" administrator, who can control everything that happens on the server: they can read, alter, delete, or block any data on that computer at will.  Even data sent encrypted over a network is eventually unencrypted and ends up on a computer controlled in this total way. With current web services we are fully trusting, in other words we are fully vulnerable to, the computer, or more specifically the people who have access to that computer, both insiders and hackers, to faithfully execute our orders, secure our payments, and so on. If somebody on the other end wants to ignore or falsify what you've instructed the web server to do, no strong security is stopping them, only fallible and expensive human institutions which often stop at national borders. The high vulnerability we have to web servers stands in sharp contrast to traditional commercial protocols, such as ticket-selling at a movie theater, that distribute a transaction so that no employee can steal money or resources undetected. There is no "root administrator" at a movie theater who can pocket your cash undetected.  Because, unlike a web server, these traditional protocols, called financial controls, can securely handle cash, you didn't have to fill out a form  to see a movie, shop for groceries, or conduct most other kinds of every-day commerce. You just plunked down some coin and took your stuff or your seat. Imperfect and slow as these processes often are (or were), these analog or paper-based institutions often provided security, financial control, and/or verifiability of fiduciary transactions in many ways far superior to what is possible on web servers, at much less hassle and privacy loss to customers. On the Internet, instead of securely and reliably handing over cash and getting our goods or services, or at least a ticket, we have to fill out forms and make ourselves vulnerable to identity theft in order to participate in e-commerce, and it often is very difficult to prohibitive to conduct many kinds of commerce, even purely online kinds, across borders and other trust boundaries. Today's computers are not very trustworthy, but they are so astronomically faster than humans at so many important tasks that we use them heavily anyway. We reap the tremendous benefits of computers and public networks at large costs of identity fraud and other increasingly disastrous attacks.Recently developed and developing technology, often called "the block chain", is starting to change this. A block chain computer is a virtual computer, a computer in the cloud, shared across many traditional computers and protected by cryptography and consensus technology. A Turing-complete block chain with large state gives us this shared computer. Earlier efforts included state-machine replication (see list of papers linked below).  QuixCoin is a recent and Ethereum is a current project that has implemented such a scheme. These block chain computers will allow us to put the most crucial parts of our online protocols on a far more reliable and secure footing, and make possible fiduciary interactions that we previously dared not do on a global network  Much as pocket calculators pioneered an early era of limited personal computing before the dawn of the general-purpose personal computer, Bitcoin has pioneered the field of trustworthy computing with a partial block chain computer. Bitcoin has implemented a currency in which someone in Zimbabwe can pay somebody in Albania without any dependence on local institutions, and can do a number of other interesting trust-minimized operations, including multiple signature authority. But the limits of Bitcoin's language and its tiny memory mean it can't be used for most other fiduciary applications, the most obvious example being risk pools that share collateral across a pool of financial instruments.A block-chain computer, in sharp contrast to a web server, is shared across many such traditional computers controlled by dozens to thousands of people. By its very design each computer checks each other's work, and thus a block chain computer reliably and securely executes our instructions up to the security limits of block chain technology, which is known formally as anonymous and probabilistic Byzantine consensus (sometimes also called Nakamoto  consensus).  The most famous security limit is the much-discussed "51% attack".  We won't discuss this limit the underlying technology further here, other than saying that the oft-used word "trustless" is exaggerated shorthand for the more accurate mouthful "trust-minimized", which I will use here.  "Trust" used in this context means the need to trust remote strangers, and thus be vulnerable to them.  Trust-minimized code means you can trust the code without trusting the owners of any particular remote computer. A smart phone user in Albania can use the block chain to interact with a computer controlled by somebody in Zimbabwe, and they don't have to know or trust each other in any way, nor do they need to depend on the institutions of either's countries, for the underlying block chain computer to run its code securely and reliably. Regardless of where any of the computers or their owners are, the block chain computer they share will execute as reliably and securely as consensus technology allows, up to the aforementioned limits. This is an extremely high level of reliability, and a very high level of security, compared to web server technology.  Instead of the cashier and ticket-ripper of the movie theater, the block chain consists of thousands of computers that can process digital tickets, money, and many other fiduciary objects in digital form.  Think of thousands of robots wearing green eye shades, all checking each other's accounting. Individually the robots (or their owners) are not very trustworthy, but collectively, coordinated by mathematics, they produce results of high reliability and security.Often block chain proponents talk about the "decentralized" block chain versus the "centralized" web or centralized institutions. It's actually the protocol (Nakamoto consensus, which is highly distributed) combined with strong cryptography, rather than just decentralization per se, that is the source of the far higher reliability and and much lower vulnerability of block chains. The cryptography provides an unforgeable chain of evidence for all transactions and other data uploaded to the block chain. Many other decentralized or peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies do not provide anything close to the security and reliability provided by a block chain protected by full Byzantine or Nakamoto consensus and cryptographic hash chains, but deceptively style themselves as block chains or cryptocurrency.A big drawback is that our online and distributed block chain computer is much slower and more costly than a web server: by one very rough estimate, about 10,000 times slower and more costly, or about the same as it cost to run a program on a normal computer in 1985. For this reason, we only run on the block chain that portion of an application that needs to be the most reliable and secure: what I call fiduciary code. Since the costs of human ("wet") problems caused by the unreliability and insecurity of web servers running fiduciary code are often far higher than the extra hardware needed to run block chain code, when web server reliability and security falls short, as it often does for fiduciary computations such as payments and financial contracts, it will often make more sense  to run that code on the block chain than to run it less reliably and securely on a web server. Even better, the block chain makes possible new fiduciary-intensive applications, such as posting raw money itself to the Internet, securely and reliably accessible anywhere on the globe -  apps that we would never dare do with a web server.What kinds of fiduciary code can we run?  We are still thinking up new applications and the categories will be in flux, but a very productive approach is to think of fiduciary applications by analogy to traditional legal code that governs traditional fiduciary institutions. Fiduciary code will often execute some of the functions traditionally thought of as the role of commercial law or security, but with software that securely and reliably spans the global regardless of traditional jurisdiction. Thus:* Property titles (registered assets), where the on-chain registry is either the legally official registry for off-chain assets or controls on-chain ones, thus providing reliable and secure custody of them. One can think of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin as property titles (or at least custody enforced by the block chain consensus protocol) to bits recognized as being a fixed portion of a currency, or as controlling unforgeably costly bits, or both. Block chains could also control hardware which controls the function of and access to physical property.* Smart contracts: here users (typically two of them) agree via user interface to execute block chain code, which may include transfer of money and other chain-titled assets at various times or under various conditions, transfer and verification of other kinds of information, and other combinations of wet or traditional (off-chain) and dry (on-chain) performance. A block chain can hold cryptocurrency as collateral (like an escrow) which incentivizes off-chain performance that can be verified on-chain, by the parties or by third parties. A full block chain computer can pool on-chain assets into a single chain-controlled risk pool spread among many similar financial contracts, reducing the amount of collateral that needs to be stored on-chain while minimizing the need for off-chain collateral calls. The block chain can also make the search, negotiation, and verification phases of contracting more reliable and secure. With on-chain smart contracts we will be able to buy and sell many online services and financial instruments by button and slider instead of by laboriously filling out forms that disclose our private information.* On-chain treasuries, trusts, and similar, where money lives on the block chain and is controlled by multiple signature ("multisig") authority.  Putting a treasury with signature authority on a block chain computer is low-hanging fruit, but is often tied to more speculative efforts under the label "distributed autonomous organization (DAO)", which may include voting shares and other mechanisms to control the treasury like a corporation or other kind of of organization.I hope to discuss these block chain applications, especially smart contracts, in future posts. While there is much futurism in many block chain discussions, including many trying to solve problems that aren't actually solved by the block chain, I will generally stick to low-hanging fruit that could be usefully implemented on Quixcoin, Ethereum, or similar technology in the near future, often interfacing to still necessary parts of traditional protocols and institutions rather than trying to reinvent and replace them in whole.References Here is a list of basic computer science papers describing the technology of block chains (including cryptocurrencies).Wet vs. dry code
[, , , , The contract, a set of promises agreed to in a "meeting of theminds", is the traditional way to formalize a relationship. The contract is the basic building block of a market economy.  Over many centuries of culturalevolution has emerged both the concept of contract and principles relatedto it, encoded into common law.  Such evolved structures are oftenprohibitively costly to rederive. If we started from scratch, using reasonand experience, it could take many centuries to redevelop sophisticatedideas like contract law and property rights that make the modern market work.  But the digital revolution challenges us to develop newinstitutions in a much shorter period of time.  By extractingfrom our current laws, procedures, and theories those principleswhich remain applicable in cyberspace, we can retain much of this deep tradition, and greatly shorten the time needed to developuseful digital institutions., Computers make possible the running of algorithms heretofore prohibitivelycostly, and networks the quicker transmission of larger and more sophisticated messages. Furthermore, computer scientists and cryptographers have recentlydiscovered many new and quite interesting algorithms. Combining these messagesand algorithms makes possible a wide variety of new protocols.  Theseprotocols, running on public networks such as the Internet, both challengeand enable us to formalize and secure new kinds of relationships in this new environment, just as contract law, business forms, and accounting controlshave long formalized and secured business relationships in the paper-based world., In electronic commerce so far, the design criteria important for automating contract execution have come from disparate fields like economics and cryptography,with little cross-communication: little awareness of the technology onthe one hand, and little awareness of its best business uses other. These efforts are striving after common objectives, and converge on the concept of smart contracts [ 1 ]., Smart contracts reduce mental and computational transaction costs imposed by either principals, third parties, or their tools.  The contractual phases of search, negotiation, commitment,performance, and adjudication constitute the realm of smart contracts.This article covers all phases, with an emphasis on performance.  Smart contracts utilize protocols and user interfaces to facilitate all steps of the contracting process. This gives us new ways to formalize and secure digital relationships which are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. , , The basic idea behind smart contracts is that many kinds of contractualclauses (such as collateral, bonding, delineation of property rights, etc.)can be embedded in the hardware and software we deal with, in such a wayas to make breach of contract expensive (if desired, sometimes prohibitivelyso) for the breacher. A canonical real-life example, which we might considerto be the primitive ancestor of smart contracts, is the humble vendingmachine. Within a limited amount of potential loss (the amount in the tillshould be less than the cost of breaching the mechanism), the machine takesin coins, and via a simple mechanism, which makes a freshman computer science problemin design with finite automata, dispense change and product accordingto the displayed price. The vending machine is a contract with bearer: anybody withcoins can participate in an exchange with the vendor. The lockbox and other security mechanisms protect the stored coins and contentsfrom attackers, sufficiently to allow profitable deployment of vending machines in a wide variety of areas., Smart contracts go beyond the vending machine in proposing to embed contractsin all sorts of property that is valuable and controlled by digital means.Smart contracts reference that property in a dynamic, often proactively enforced form, and provide much better observation and verification where proactivemeasures must fall short., As another example, consider a hypothetical digital security systemfor automobiles. The smart contract design strategy suggests that wesuccessively refine security protocols to more fully embed in a propertythe contractual terms which deal with it. These protocols wouldgive control of the cryptographic keys for operating the property to the person who rightfully owns that property, based on the terms of the contract.In the most straightforward implementation, the car can be rendered inoperable unless the proper challenge-response protocol is completed with its rightfulowner, preventing theft. But if the car is being used to securecredit, strong security implemented in this traditional waywould create a headache for the creditor - the repo man would no longer be able toconfiscate a deadbeat's car. To redress this problem, we can create a smartlien protocol: if the owner fails to make payments, the smart contract invokes the lien protocol, which returns control of the car keys to the bank. This protocol might be much cheaper and more effective than a repo man.  A further reification would provably remove the lien when the loan has been paid off, as well as account for hardship and operational exceptions. For example, it would be rude to revoke operation of the car while it's doing 75 down the freeway.  , In this process of successive refinementwe've gone from a crude security system to a reified contract:, Mature security systems will be undertaking different behavior for different contracts. To continuewith our example, if the automobile contract were a lease, the final paymentwould switch off leasee access; for purchase on credit, it would switchoff creditor access. A security system, by successive redesign, increasingly approaches the logic of the contract which governs the rights and obligations covering the object, information, orcomputation being secured. Qualitatively different contractual terms, as well as technological differences in the property,give rise to the need for different protocols., , , Control protocols, and the professions of auditing and accounting [ 2 ]based on them, play a critical but ill-analyzed role in our economy.Economists lump them, along with other costs of negotiating andensuring the performance of contracts,under their catch-all rubric of "transaction costs".But without controls, large corporations and the economies of scalethey create would not be possible. Controls allow a quarrelsomespecies ill-suited to organizations larger than small tribes to work together on vast projects like manufacturing jumbo jets and runninghospitals. These control protocols are the result of many centuriesof business experience and have a long future ahead of them, but thedigital revolution will soon cause these paper-era techniques to be dramatically augmented by, and eventually integrate into,smart contracts., Controls enable auditing of contract performances, allowingmore precise inference of the behavior of an agent. Auditingis costly, so it is undertaken by random sampling.Economists study the substitutability between the probabilityof verifying a breach and the magnitude of legal fines, wherephysical enforcement is used. Conceivably, one could substituteincreasingly high penalties for increasingly rarer and lessexpensive auditing.   However, this is not robust to real-worldconditions of imperfect information., Since controls primarily address the implicit contracts betweenemployees and employer, there is little mapping from contract tocontrol.  A secondary function of controls to to monitor contracts with other organizations.  Here there is some mapping, but it is confoundedby the integration of the two functions in most controls.Rather than based on contractual terms, controls are typicallybased on managerial authorization., Controls are typically based around amounts of money andquantities of goods. A canonical control is double entrybookkeeping, where two books are kept, and there mustbe arithmetic reconciliation between the books.To conceal an irregularity, necessary to omit from both sides, or to record entries offsetting the irregularity. Notice thatthere is a problem distinguishing error from fraud. Thisproblem crops up in many areas in both auditing and smart contracts.To illustrate, here are two common control techniques:, Imprest: this is a family of controls involving the receipt or disbursement of bearer certificates (usually notes and coins).One example is the protocol used at most movie theaters.Entry is segregated from payment by introducing tickets and establishing two employee roles, the ticket seller in a booth,and the ticket stub salesman at the entrance. Periodically,a bookkeeper reconciles the number of tickets with the totalpaid. Discrepancy again indicates fraud or error., Customer audit: Techniques to get the customer to generate initial documentation of a transaction. For example,pricing goods at $.99 forces the employee to open the cash register to make change, generating a receipt., A complete control protocol typically features the generation of initial documentation, segregation of duties, and arithmetic reconciliation of quantities of goods,standard service events, and money., Of these, the segregation of duties deserves special comment., It has long been recognized that an intermediaryis more trustworthy when it is distributed. In a large business, transactions are divided up sothat no single person can commit fraud. Segregationof duties is an instance of the principle of required conspiracy. For example, the functions of warehouse/delivery,sales, and receipt of payments are each performed by different parties,with a policy that each party reports every transaction to a fourth function,accounting. Any singular reported activity (e.g., delivery without receiptof payment) indicates potential fraud (e.g., a delivery was made to a customerand the payment pocketed instead of being put into the corporate treasury).Segregation of duties is the auditor's favorite tool. Where it is absentthe auditor cries "foul", just as a good engineer would reactto a single point of failure. Many cryptographic systems have rightfullygone down to commercial failure because they ground down to trust in asingle entity rather than segregating functions so as to require conspiracy., There are least three significant differences between the scope and emphasis of smart contracts and controls.  Controlsare paper-era protocols designed around static forms,place little emphasis on confidentiality, and are based on management authorizations rather than one-to-one relationships., Smart contracts can be based on a wide variety of interactive protocols and user interfaces, and can be involved in a wide variety of kinds of contractual performance. Control protocols,developed in the era of paper, are based on static forms passed as messages and processed in tables and spreadsheets. Controls focus on money and counts of standardized goods and serviceevents, easily recorded by numbers and manipulated by arithmetic, while mostly ignoring other kinds or aspects of contractual performance.  Checksums on numbers, the basis of reconciliation, are crude and forgeable compared to cryptographic hashes. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) keeps these static forms and maintains reliance on controls. It uses cryptographic hashes for nothing more sophisticated than integrity checks on individual messages., Controls place little emphasis on confidentiality, at least in the modern accounting literature. The emphasis on confidentiality in paper-era protocols is lacking because violation of often implicit confidences, via replication of data, was much more difficult with paper. Furthermore, technologies forprotecting confidentiality while auditing were not feasible.Businesses traditionally trusted accounting firms withconfidences, a trust that has eroded over the last century, and will erode still further as accounting firms start taking advantage of the vast amounts of inside and marketing information they are collecting from their customers' databases during audits.Using paper-based protocols in a digital world, there are few effective controls against the auditors themselves.Post-unforgeable transaction logs and multiparty secure computation,discussed below, indicate the possibility of cryptographicprotocols to implement less relavatory but more effective auditing trails and controls; their use may beable to ameliorate the growing problems with data miningand breach of confidentiality., , Auditors place quite a bit of trust in management to authorize transactionsin a secure and productive manner. Objecting to this dual trust in management and distrust of employees inherent in the accounting tradition, there has been a trend in the last two decades towards a loosening of controls as a part of hierarchy flattening and empowerment of professional employees.Unfortunately, loose controls have led to several recent scandals in thebanking and investment trade. The most recent view is that there must be a learned tradeoff between controls and empowerment. The smartcontract view is that we need smarter controls, originating at the ownership of the company, and entailing less asymmetry between management and other professional employees. This means converting many implicit employee contracts to more explicit smart contracts based on more direct relationships between owners (or at least their directors) and employees, and symmetric formalizations between employees., , Although most of these differences are biased against controls,these traditional protocols have a long future ahead of them, simplybecause they have a long past. They are highly evolved, hundredsof years old (double-entry bookkeeping, for example, predates the Renaissance). Smart contractswill incorporate many techniques and strategies from controlprotocols, such as generation of an initial record, segregationof duties, and reconciliation. It will not be long, however, before smart contracts start augmenting and transforming traditional business procedures, making a wide variety of new business structures possible and in the long run replacing traditional controls., , EDI loses some security features provided by physical paper(such as difficulty of copying) while not gaining advantages from the wide variety of protocols possible beyond simple message-passing of static forms.This article examples a much richer set of protocols., EDI contracts tend to be merely reiterations of existing terms andconditions, with only some timing expectations changed for the electronicenvironment. By redesigning our business relationships to takeadvantage of a richer set of protocols, smart contracts cantake us far beyond the paper-based paradigm of shipping around forms in a secure manner., The following classification, derived from Sokol [3 ],illustrates the variety of business formsthat have been rendered in electronic form:, There are many weak enforcement mechanisms which also serve a similar purpose, like the little arms in parking garages that prevent you from leaving without paying, the sawhorsesand tape around construction sites, most fences, etc.  Civilization is filled with contracts embedded in the world., More subtle examples include taxi meters, cashregister readouts, computer displays, and so on.  As with hard focal points, the cost of hagglingcan often be reduced by invoking technology asauthority. "I'm sorry, but that's what the computer says", argue clerks around the world. "I know I estimated $50to get to Manhattan, but the meter reads $75", says thetaxi driver., , One major category of costs include the cost of anticipating, agreeing to, and clearly writing down the various eventualities. These arelargely mental transaction costs, although online research tools,for example, may bring more information about eventualities., Most contractual dispute involves an unforeseen or unspecified eventuality. A common example of an unspecified eventuality is that the parties behind a pseudonym might change: corporate change of officers, sales of brand names, and so on.Dye [ 4 ] suggests that weestimate the cost of writing down a function of the qualityof input q traded a function of price: q = f(p). The costhe suggests is the number of different values q can take onas p varies: the number of discrete consequences of making thecontract at p. Hart suggests that we should take into account the simplicity of the function. This leads us to the MinimumDescription Length of Rissanen and Wallace, an approximationfor the universal description length of a function. , An even more sophisticated model would account for the computationalcosts of foreseeing these eventualities, some of which maybe uncomputable (and therefore of infinite cost). Whereeventualities remain unspecified, contracts remain incomplete., Where counterparties lack focal points, they lack a meetingof minds. Negotiation addresses this gap; the farther apartthe focal points (in terms of value), the more expensive the negotiations. There are a varietyof institutions of negotiation, which economists study underthe rubric of "mechanisms". These range from simple hagglingto sophisticated auctions and exchanges., Securing the contractual phases, especially performance,against third parties can be costly; this is one of the majortransaction costs which smart contracts address. This is discussed under "Attacks Against Smart Contracts" below., One example where we must untangle mental from computationaltransaction costs is in examining the idea that lower computationalcosts make micropayments possible., The function of prices, from the point of view of a shopper,is to let the shopper map his personal resources (budget) to his personalvalues (unique and not directly observable). This mental process requirescomparison of the purchase price of a good to its personal value. Thisentails a significant mental cost, which sets the most basic lower boundson transaction costs. For example, comparing the personal value of a large,diverse set of low-priced goods might require a mental expenditure greaterthan the prices of those goods (where mental expenditure may be measurableas the opportunity costs of not engaging in mental labor for wages, orof not shopping for a fewer number of more comparable goods with lowermental accounting costs). In this case it makes sense to put the goodstogether into bundles with a higher price and an initutive synergy, untilthe mental accounting costs of shoppers are sufficiently low. , These mental accounting costs, not the physical or computational oramortized R&amp;D costs of payment or billing method, set the main lowerbound on price granularity. Judging from pricing granularity trends suchas the trend towards flat rates in online services, online pricing granularityis far above suggested micropayment levels of a few cents or even fractionsof a cent. The mental accounting costs for a typical on-line consumer seemto be somewhat higher than those in more familiar areas of commerce. These mental costs often dwarf the computational costs; reductions in the per transaction computational costs of smart contracts may often be economically insignificant. Other transaction costs, such asfraud, theft, and unforeseeability, are usually more important objectivesfor cost reduction by smart contracts., Smart contracts often involve trusted third parties, exemplified byan intermediary, who is involved in the performance, and an adjudicator,who is invoked to resolve disputes arising out of performance (or lackthereof).  Intermediaries can operate during search, negotiation, commitment,and/or performance. Hidden knowledge, or adverse selection, occurs ex-ante; hidden actions (moral hazards) occur ex-post., Here are some examples of contemporary electronic commerceactivities and the phases of contracting they deal with:, The first objective of smart contract designis observability, the ability of the principals toobserve each others' performance of the contract, or to prove their performanceto other principals. The field of accounting is, roughly speaking, primarilyconcerned with making contracts an organization is involved in more observable., Economists discuss "hidden knowledge", also known as "adverseselection", which can occur due to lack of ability to observepotential counterparties during the search and negotiationphases.  Another major problem is "hidden actions", also known as"moral hazard", which can occur due to the lack of observability and ability to drop out of contract during the performancephase of a contract. , One important task of smart contracts, that has been largely overlookedby traditional EDI, is critical to "the meeting of the minds"that is at the heart of a contract: communicating the semantics of theprotocols to the parties involved. There is ample opportunity in smartcontracts for "smart fine print": actions taken by the softwarehidden from a party to the transaction. For example, grocery store POSmachines don't tell customers whether or not their names are being linkedto their purchases in a database. The clerks don't even know, and they'veprocessed thousands of such transactions under their noses. Thus, via hiddenaction of the software, the customer is giving away information they mightconsider valuable or confidential, but the contract has been drafted, andtransaction has been designed, in such a way as to hide those importantparts of that transaction from the customer. , Without user interfaces smart contracts are largely invisible, like the electronics in newer car engines. This is both a blessing - counterpartiesdon't have to feel like they're dealing with user-hostile computers - and a curse - the "smart fine print" problem of hidden actions., Here's a little example of smart fine print:, To properly communicate transaction semantics, we need good visual metaphorsfor the elements of the contract. These would hide the details of the protocolwithout surrendering control over the knowledge and execution of contractterms. A primitive but good example was provided by the SecureMosaic Web browser from CommerceNet. Encryption was shown by putting the document in an envelope,and a digital signature by affixing a seal onto the document or envelope.On the other hand, most Web servers log connections, and sometimes even transactions, without warning users - classic hidden actions., , Amid all the hype about "information warfare", lost in the noise is the factthat it is impossible to commit an act of physical violence over theNet. That includes not only all physical crimes of coercion, butalso arrest, incarceration, and other traditional methods of lawenforcement. Because of this fact, and the jurisdictional swampthat is the Internet, this article concentrates on means ofprotecting against breach and third parties that do not relyon law enforcement., We can categorize the security measures against breach,eavesdropping, and interference in the following manner:, , So our second objective is verifiability, the ability of a principal to prove to an adjudicator that a contract has been performed or breached,or the ability of the adjudicator to find this out by other means. The disciplines of auditing and investigation roughly correspond with verification of contract performance. , , Our third objective of smart contract design is privity, the principlethat knowledge and control over the contents and performance of a contractshould be distributed among parties only as much as is necessary for theperformance of that contract. This is a generalization of the common lawprinciple of contract privity, which states that third parties, other thanthe designated adjudicators and intermediaries, should have no say in theenforcement of a contract. Generalized privity goes beyond this to formalizethe common claim, "it's none of your business". Attacks againstprivity are epitomized by third parties Eve the eavesdropper, a passiveobserver of contents or performance, and malicious Mallet, who activelyinterferes with performance or steals service. Under this model privacyand confidentiality, or protecting the value of information about a contract,its parties, and its performance from Eve, is subsumed under privity, asare property rights. The field of security (especially, for smart contracts,computer and network security), roughly corresponds to the goal of privity., PRIVITY OF CONTRACT. The relation which subsists between two contractingparties [ 5 ]., Here being "in privity" to a contract is simply defined as being a partyto the contract. We can get more insight by looking into the requirementsfor becoming such a party, by forming such a contract. The chief requirementis a "meeting of the minds": a state of mutual agreement., We have to go back more than a century to find significant usage ofthe word beyond its parched modern usage in English law. In English literatureprior to the 20th century, "privity" appears in contexts whichindicate two connotations. The first, most linguistically obvious connotation,is that one has "privity" to an event if one has knowledge of it that isshared by few others. In this interpretation it means being privy to an event. The second connotation is that one assents to that event,or to its consequences. The event might have been called to the attention ofothers; it or its consequences might have been prevented or avoided. "Privity"thus often carries the connotation of moral or legal responsibility. Theevent is usually, furthermore, some human action; what contract law refersto as "performance" when such action has been promised.Much of this knowledge is what Michael Polanyi describes as "tacit knowledge" [ 6 ], knowledge which cannot be articulated but must remain subjective. Furthermore, even explicit knowledgeof special circumstances is widely dispersed [ 7 ]. The basis of privity isthe distribution of knowledge, both articulable and implicit., The modern legal principle of "privity" [ 8 ] has been modified in manyjurisdictions by the doctrine foreseeability. The fixed, clear boundaryof foreseeability around a contract provided by privity is erased, in anattempt to define the scope of responsibility as "foreseeability" in particular cases. Now the courts have to draw new clarified boundaries,lest the law remain a muddle., One has "privacy" with respect to some information against those with whom one is not in privity, in the early "privy to"sense. In contract law, "privity" refers only implicitly to some relativelack of third party knowledge, but refers directly to third party _control_at law. In reconstructing privity for our own uses, we can generalize theconcept to refer to lack of both third party knowledge _and_ control., This brings us to an important and fascinating parallel which shows the utility of this revitalized concept of privity in the information age. Our definition of privity now corresponds to the passive and active attacks against a data security system. Passive attacks against privacy are epitomized by Eve, the eavesdropper. Active attacks against performance are epitomized by Mallet, a malicious interferer [ 9 ]., Since "meeting of the minds", one connotation of "privity", comesunder the rubric of observability, we will use "privity" to refer to protection from third parties. Thus privity is the protection of the contents and activitities of a relationship - or, specifically, the terms, performance, and adjudication of a contract - from third parties., , To maintain knowledge and control, performance must be encapsulated:protected from outside influences, especially sophisticatedattacks. This is the idea behind both the legal doctrine ofprivity, which restricts redress to the parties to a contract,and the idea of property rights.  , Our generalized privity thus encompasses property rights as stable objects linked to particular contracts (and thereby the parties in privity to such contracts, the "owners").Privity creates a clear boundary within which operate acoherent set of rights, responsibilities, and the knowledge with whichto carry out those responsibilities and protect those rights. Clarified boundaries also allow accountability. Protection fromextraneous interference allows us to focus responsibilityfor the consequences of contract-related activity onto the parties to thecontract., , Privity says that we want to minimize vulnerability to thirdparties. Verifiability and observability often require that we invoke them.An intermediary must be trusted with some of the contents and/or performanceof the contract. An adjudicator must be trusted with some of the contents,and some of the history of performance, and to resolve disputes and invokepenalties fairly. In smart contract design we want to get the most outof intermediaries and adjudicator, while minimizing exposure to them. Onecommon outcome is that confidentiality is violated only in case of dispute., Many kinds ofspecific performance are often entrusted to intermediaries.We must be able to trust the intermediary(credit agency, anti-virus software vendor, certificate intermediary, digitalcash mint, etc.) with their particular claims (about creditworthiness,dangerous byte patterns, identity, conservation of the money supply, etc.)As Ronald Reagan remarked in a slightly different context, "trust but verify". To deserve our trust,intermediaries must convince us that their claims are true. We need to beable to "ping" their veracity, verifying that certain claimedtransactions in fact occurred. An entire profession exists in market economiesto perform this function: auditing. , Ideally, observability and verifiability can also include the abilityto differentiate between intentional violations of the contract and goodfaith errors, but this is difficult in practice, since the differenceis often largely one of subjective, unrevealed intent. , Protocols come in three basic types. I have modified theterminology of Schneier [ 5 ] to match more closely to thecorresponding business terminology:, The corresponding smart contracts elaborate on "Alice" todistinguish between the software (in two components, theendpoint of protocol and the user interface), and Alice herself.Cryptographic and other computer security mechanisms give us a kit oftools and parts from which we can build protocols, which form the basisof smart contracts., , A family of protocols, called cryptographic protocols because their first application wascomputerized "secret writing", provide many of the basic building blocks that implement the improved tradeoffs between observability, verifiability, privity, and enforceability in smart contracts.Contrary to the common wisdom, obscurity is often critical to security.Cryptographic protocols are built around foci of obscurity called keys.A key's immense unknown randomness allows the rest of the system to besimple and public. The obscurity of a large random number, so vast thata lucky guess is astronomically unlikely, is the foundation upon which cryptographic protocols, and smart contracts based on them,are built. , Two significant cautions are in order when thinking about howcryptographic protocols can be used in online relationships.The first is that protocols usually provide security "up to" some assumption. This assumptionis a remaining weak point which a complete working systemmust address in some reasonable manner. One common endpoint isis assumptions about trusted third parties. Often the degree or function of the trustis not well specified, and it is up to the real-world systemsanalyst to characterize and ameliorate these exposures. The best mediated protocols only trust the intermediary or counterpartywith a well limited function.  , Even without trusted third parties, cryptographic protocols oftenground out in trust of the counterparty. For example, encryption of a message provides confidentiality up to the actions of parties with decrypting keys. Encryption does notstop key holders from posting  plain text to Usenet.We cannot just say that encryption provides "confidentiality"and leave our concern for confidentiality at that., The second caution is that much of the terminology used in the cryptographic literatureto name protocols ("signatures", "cash", etc.) ismisleading. Sometimes the terminology falls short on substantialmatters: a "digital signature", for example, is not biometric and is based on a key that can easily be copied if not protectingby another mechanism. Often cryptographicprotocols can be generalized to much wider purposes than impliedby the label. For example, "digital cash" is a verygeneral protocol which can implement a wide variety ofbearer certificates and conservation wrappers for distributedobjects.,  , Protocols for smart contracts should be structured in such a way as to make their contracts , A vandal can be a strategy or sub-strategy of a game whose utility isat least partially a function of one's own negative utility; or it canbe a mistake by a contracting party to the same effect. "Naive"simply refers to both lack of forethought as to the consequences of a breach,as well as the relatively low amount of resources expended to enable thatbreach. Naive vandalism is common enough that it must be taken into consideration.A third category, (c) sophisticated vandalism (where the vandals can andare willing to sacrifice substantial resources), for example a militaryattack by third parties, is of a special and difficult kind that doesn'toften arise in typical contracting, so that we can place it in a separatecategory and ignore it here. The distinction between naive and sophisticatedstrategies has been computationally formalized in algorithmicinformation theory , The expected lossdue to third party attack is called the exposure. Thecost of third parties to breach the security mechanismis the breach cost. If the breach cost is greater thanthe expected benefit, we can expect an incentive compatibleattacker to breach the security.  , A wide variety of new cryptographic protocols have emerged in recentyears. The most traditional kind of cryptography is secret key cryptography,in which Alice and Bob (our exemplar parties to a smart contract) use asingle shared, prearranged key to encrypt messages between them. A fundamentalproblem we will see throughout these protocols is the need to keep keyssecret, and public key cryptography helps solve this. In this technique,Alice generates two keys, called the private and public keys. She keepsthe private key secret and well protected, and publishes the public key.When Bob wishes to send a message to Alice, he encrypts a message withher public key, sends the encrypted message, and she decrypts the messagewith her private key. The private key provides a "trapdoor" thatallows Alice to compute an easy inverse of the encryption function thatused the public key. The public key provides no clue as to what the privatekey is, even though they are mathematically related. The RSAalgorithm is the most widely used method of public key cryptography. , Public key cryptography also makes possible a wide variety of digitalsignatures. These proves that a piece of data (hereafter referred toas just an "object") was in active contact with the private keycorresponding to the signature: the object was actively "signed"with that key. There are two steps to an authentication protocol:signing and verification. These may occur synchronously, or, in manypublic protocols, a signature may be verified at some distant time in the future., , The digital signature probably should have been called a"digital stamp" or "digital seal" since its functionresembles more those methods than an autograph. In particular, it is notbiometric like an autograph, although incorporation of a typed-in passwordas part of the private key used to sign can sometimes substitute for anautograph. In many Asian countries, a hand-carved wooden block, calleda "chop", is often used instead of autographs. Every chop isunique, and because of the unique carving and wood grain cannot be copied.A digital signature is similar to the chop, since every newly generatedkey is unique, but it is trivial to copy the key if obtained from the holder.A digital signature relies on the assumption that the holder will keepthe private key secret., A blind signature publically authenticates privy information(but can we use non-privy signatures blindly as well?)/This is a digital signature and secret-key encryptionprotocol that together have the mathematical property of commutativity,so that they can be stripped in reverse of the order they were applied.It's like stamping an unknown document through carbon paper (withouthaving to worry about smudging). The effect is that Bob "signs" an object, for which he can verify its general form, but cannot see its specific content. Typically the keyof the signature defines the meaning of the signed object, rather thanthe contents of the object signed, so that Bob doesn't sign a blank check.Blind signatures used in digital bearer certificates, where Bob is the clearingagent, and in Chaumiancredentials , where Bob is the credential issuer., So far, we've assumed parties like Alice and Bob are monolithic. Butin the world of smart contracts, they will use computer-based softwareagents and smart cards to do their electronic bidding. Keys are not necessarilytied to identities, and the task of doing such binding turns out to bemore difficult than at first glance. Once keys are bound, they need tobe well protected, but wide area network connections are notoriously vulnerable to hacking. , If we assume that the attacker has the ability to intercept and redirectany messages in the network protocol, as is the case on wide area networkssuch as the Internet, then we must also assume, for practical all commercialoperating systems, that they would also be able to invade client if notmerchant computers and find any keys lying on the disk. , There's no completely satisfactory solution to end point operationssecurity from network-based attacks, but here's a strategy for practicallydefanging this problem for public-key based systems: , All public key operation can be performed inside an unreadable hardwareboard or smart card on a machine with a very narrow serial-line connection (ie, it carriesonly a simple single-use protocol with well-verified security) to a dedicatedfirewall. This is economical for high traffic servers, but may be less practical for individual users. Besides better security,it has the added advantage that hardware speeds up the public key computations., If Mallet's capability is to physically seize the machine, a weakerform of key protection will suffice. The trick is to hold the keys in volatilememory. This makes the PC proof from physical attacks - all that neededto destroy the keys is to turn off the PC. If the key backups can be hiddenin a different, secure physical location, this allows the user of thisPC to encrypt large amounts of data both on the PC itself and on publiccomputer networks, without fear that physical attack against the PC willcompromise that data. The data is still vulnerable to a "rubber hoseattack" where the owner is coerced into revealing the hidden keys., For more information seeIntroduction to Capability Based Security, , Information about who is talking to whom, such as can be found on telephone bills, can be quite valuable even without records of the actual content.Confidential messsaging is necessary for the some of the privity features of Chaumian credentialsand bearer certificates to be strongly implemented on an actual network.To provide this traffic confidentiality, a digital mix can allowparties to communicate across a network without revealing their partnersto network providers or the outside world. In a mix, traffic analysis byEve is prevented by the Russian-doll encryption of the message by the senderwith the public keys of each mix operator in the chain, and the mixingof messages by each operator, so that panoptic wiretapper Eve loses trackof the messages. For the sender/recipient pair to remain confidential,only 1 out of N of the operators needs to be trusted with their local trafficinformation, although Eve can sometimes gather statistics over large numbersof messages between the same partners to eventually guess who is talkingto whom. The communicating parties can also be mutually anonymous, andwith normal encryption need trust no other parties with the content ofmessages. The "Mixmaster" remailer implementsmost of the features of a digital mix [ 10 ]., Quorum distribution of performance or control overresources can be based on the secret sharing of keys needed to perform or control a resource. These are also known asthreshold techniques. These are methods of splitting a key (and thus control over any object encrypted with that key) into N parts, of which only M are needed to recreate the key, but less than M of the parts provide no information about the key. Secret sharing is a potent tool for distributing control over objects between principals. , Markus Jacobsson has designed a quorum of mints for signing digital coins,for example. Quorum establishes a "required conspiracy" of Mout of N to perform a function, providing an option for stronger protectionthan the typical 2 out of N used in segregation of duties, and greaterconfidence in the security underlying the segregation. , Traditionally, auditors have contacted counterparties in order to verifythat a transaction actually took place (The "principle of requiredconspiracy" at work again). With post-unforgeable logs, via ahierarchical system of one-way hash functions, a party can publicallycommit to transactions as they are completed by publishing signed cumulativehashes of the transaction stream. The confidentiality of the transactionis fully maintained until an auditor "pings" the transactionto determine its actual nature. The counterparty identity can remain confidential,because it is not required to establish the other facts of the transaction.The only attack is to forge transactions in real time, as the transactionitself takes place, which in most practical cases will be unfeasible. Mostaccounting fraud involves analyzing sets of completed transactions andthen forging them to make them compute to a desired counterfactual result., There are two major complications. The first is that this virtual computeris very slow: one machine instruction per network message.  The secondis that some parties learn the results before others.  Several papers have disussedthe fraction of parties one must trust in order to be assured oflearning the correct output. The mechanism must be constructed so that a sufficient number of parties have an incentive to passon the correct result, or reputation, side contracts, etc. usedto the same effect., , With these caveats, any algorithmic intermediary can, in principle, bereplaced by a trustworthy virtual computer. In practice, becauseof the two complications, we usually construct more limited protocols out of more efficient elements., Multiparty secure computer theory, by making possible privy virtualintermediation, has major implications for all phases of contracting. This can be seen most clearly in the area of negotiations.A "mechanism" in economics is an abstract model of an institution which communicates with its participants via messages, and whose rules can be specified algorithmically. These institutions can be auctions, exchanges, voting, and so on.  They typically implement some kind of negotiationor decision making process.  , Economists assume a trusted intermediary operates the mechanism.Here's a simple example of using this virtual computer for a mechanism.Alice can submit a bid price, and Bob anask price, to their shared virtual computer which has one instruction, "A greater than B?". The computer then returns "true" if Alice's bid is greater than Bob's offer. A slightly more sophisticated computer maythen decide the settlement price according to a number of differentalgorithms (Alice's bid, Bob's ask, split the difference, etc.)This implements the mechanism "blind bargaining" with no trustedintermediary., In principle, since any computable problem can be solved on this virtual computer (they are "Turing complete"), any computable economic mechanism can be implemented without a trusted intermediary. In practice, these secure virtual computers run very slowly (one virtual machine instruction per network message), and the order in which participants learn results often matters. But the existence proof, that any economic mechanism can be run without a trusted intermediary, up to temporal issues, is very exciting. This means that, in principle,any contract which can be negotiated through a trusted third party(such as an auction or exchange) can be negotiated directly.So, in some abstract sense, the only remaining "hard" problemsin smart contract negotiations are (a) problems considered hard evenwith a trusted intermediary (for the standard economic reasons),(b) nonsimultaneity problems in learning the decision, and (c) the task of algorithmically specifying the negotiating rules and output contract terms (This includes cases where anintermediary adds knowledge unavailable to the participants,such as a lawyer giving advice on how to draft a contract)., Applying this kind of analysis to the performance phase of contracts is less straightforward. For starters, economictheories of the performance phase are not as well developed orsimple as the mechanism theory of negotiations. Indeed, most economic theory simply assumes that all contracts can be perfectly and costlessly enforced. Some of the "transaction cost" literature has started to move beyond this assumption, but there are few compelling results or consensus theories in the area of techniques and costs of contract enforcement., Performance phase analysis with multiparty secure computer theorywould seem to apply only to those contracts which can be performed inside the virtual computer. But the use of post-unforgeable auditing logs, combinedwith running auditing protocols inside the shared virtual computer,allows a wide variety of performances outside the virtual computerto at least be observed and verified by selected arbitrators, albeit not proactively self-enforced.  , The participants in thismutually confidential auditing protocolcan verify that the books match the details of transactions stored in a previously committed transaction log, and that the numbers add up correctly.   The participants can compute summary statistics on their confidentiallyshared transaction logs, including cross-checking of the logs against counterparties to a transaction, without revealing those logs. They only learn what can be inferred from the statistics, can't see the details of the transactions.Another intriguing possibility is that the virtual computer can keep state over long periods of time, allowing sophisticated forms of privy and self-enforcing secured credit., With mutually confidential auditing we will be able to gain highconfidence in the factuality of counterparties' claims and reports withoutrevealing identifying and other detailed information from the transactionsunderlying those reports. These provide the basis for solid reputationsystems, and other trusted third party systems, that maintain integrityacross time, communications, and summarization, and preserve confidentialityfor transaction participants. Knowing that mutually confidential auditing can be accomplished in principle may lead us to practical solutions. Eric Hughes' "encrypted open books" was one attempt., , Bearer certificates implement transferable rights on standardized contracts.Each kind of contract (for example, each denomination of "coin" in digital cash) corresponds to a digital signature, just as each issue of Federal Reserve Notes or stock certificates corresponds to a particular plate.  , In the most straightforward bearer certificate protocol, the issuer and transfer agent (the same entity, for our purposes, though they can easily be unbundled) create a serial number (really a largeunguessable random number, rather than a sequence), and add it to a listof issued certificates. The transfer agent clears a transferby checking the signature to identify and nature of the bearer contract and verify that it was made, then looking on thatcontract's issued list to make sure the serial number is there,then removing the serial number. Alternatively, the issuer can let the issuee make up theserial number, then, when cleared, check the signature and putthe number on the list of cleared certificates. The signature providesthe assurance that the certificate is indeed the the particularkind of contract with bearer, while the serial number assures thatthe same instance of that contract is not cleared or redeemed more thanonce. In these simple versions, the transfer agent can link the transferee to the transferor for all transfers. To implement the privacy characteristics of coins and physical bearer certificates, we need to add unlinkability features., Blind signatures can be used to make certificate transfers unlinkablevia serial number. Privacy fromthe transfer agent can take the form of transferee-unlinkability, transferor-unlinkability,or "double blinded" where both transferor and transferee areunlinkable by the transfer agent or a collusion of a transferagent and counterparty. , Bearer certificates comein an "online" variety, cleared during every transfer, and thusboth verifiable and observable, and an "offline" variety, whichcan be transferred without being cleared, but is only verifiable when finallycleared, by revealing any the clearing name of any intermediate holder whotransferred the object multiple times (a breach of contract). , This unlinkability is often called "anonymity", but the issueof whether accounts are issued to real names or pseudonyms, andwhether transferor and transferee identify themselves to eachother, is orthogonal to unlinkability by the transfer agentin the online model. In the off-line model, account identification(or at least a highly reputable and/or secured pseudonym)is required: passing  an offline certificate a second time revealsthis identity. Furthermore, communications channels can allow Eve to link transferor and transferee, unless they take the precaution ofusing an anonymous remailer. Online clearing does make lack of identification a reasonable option for many kinds of transactions, althoughcommon credit and warrantee situations often benefit from or even require identification., When confronting an attempted clearing of a cleared serialnumber, we face an error-or-fraud dilemma similar to the onewe encountered above in double entry bookkeeping. The ecash(tm)protocol from DigiCash actually takes advantage of this ambiguity,second-transferring certificates on purpose to recover from a network failure. When certificates are lost over the net it is not clear to the transferor whether they have been received and cleared by the transferee or not.   Second-transferring directly with the transfer agent resolves the ambiguity.  This only works with the online protocol.  The issue of distinguishing error from fraud is urgent in the offline protocol, but there is as yet no highly satisfactory solution.This problem is often intractable due to the subjectivity of intent., Issuance and cleared transfer of references to a distributed objectconserves the usage of that object. This object becomes "scarce" in economicterms, just as use of physical objects is finite. Conserved objects provide the basis for a software economics that moreclosely resembles economics of scarce physical objects.Conserved objects can be used to selectively exclude not onlyscarce physical resources (such as CPU time, network bandwidthand response time, etc.), but also fruits of intellectuallabor - as long as one is willing to pay the price to interactwith that information over the network rather than locally(cf. content rights management). Conservation immunizes objectsand the resources they encapsulate to denial of serviceattacks.Bearer certificate protocols can be used to transfer references to a particular instanceor set of instances of an object, just as theycan be used to transfer other kinds of standardized rights., Digital cash isthe premier example of a digital bearer certificate.  The issue andtransfer agent is called a "mint".Bearer certificate protocols enable online payment whilehonoring the characteristics desired of bearer notes, especially unforgeability (via the clearing mechanism) and transfer confidentiality (via mixing and blinding)., To implement a full transaction of payment for services, we often need need more than just the digital cash protocol; we need a protocol that guaranteesthat service will be rendered if payment is made, and vice versa. Currentcommercial systems use a wide variety of techniques to accomplish this,such as certified mail, face to face exchange, reliance on credit historyand collection agencies to extend credit, etc. Potential smartcontract protocols in this area are discussed under Credit., A credential is a claim made by one party about another. A positivecredential is one the second party would prefer to reveal, such asa degree from a prestigious school, while that party would prefer not toreveal a negative credential such as a bad credit rating. , A Chaumian credentialis a cryptographic protocol for proving that one's pseudonym(for example, the identification number one uses in a healthcare system) possesses credentials issued to one's other pseudonyms, without revealing linkages between these pseudonyms or between pseudonym and true name. It'sbased around the is-a-person credential the true name credential,used to prove, without revealing, the linkage between pseudonyms, and to prevent the transfer of pseudonyms between parties., Watermark schemes work by altering less significant bits ofcontent - usuallya picture; sound works less well and text is difficult. These altered bits typically contain the identities of the publisher and viewer, andperhaps other information related to the contract. The ideais that, when investigators scan released content, the watermarkwill finger the breacher of the contract (or violator of copyrightlaw). , Watermark investigation can be assisted by a quite inexpensivetechnique, Web spiders. These spiders look for redistributed watermarked material on the Web. The customer originating thecopy can then be fingered., One attack against watermarks is to overwrite likely watermark bits with other patterns legitimate to viewing software. Theentanglement of watermark bits with bits important to the picture can be made rather obscure, but not strongly so by the standards of cryptography.Another attack is to steal content from a customer and distribute it as is. The watermark will finger the victim, rather than the thief., All watermark schemes can be defeated with sufficient effort.  These schemes can then be distributed as software worldwide.Once the initial effort is put into breaking a scheme, the marginalcost of breaking it is minimal. Furthermore, once the watermarkis removed, the content can be distributed and even published [ 12 ]with secure anonymity., In sum, watermark schemes can add significant risk to the copyingof of low value or ephemeral information. This will be sufficientfor many kinds of content, such as news or product updates.  It won't stop, for long, the redistribution of high-value content.   Since watermarks require traceable identification, they reduce customer privacy and require the inconvenience of registration and authentication, adding to the transaction costs of contentpurchase., , As a result, some publishers have begun putting their research dollarsinto a radical alternative, innocuously dubbed the "secure CPU" (SPU)[ 13 ].This is a CPU that is "secure" against the owner of the computer!To enforce copyright or content contracts, the SPU monitors all content-related activity. Some marketing literature even lists,alongside the traditional copyright, a new "right" of publishers to monitor the usage of their content. Remarkably enough, thesepanoptic non-personal computers are the focus of major R&amp;D efforts., , The radical SPU projects demonstrate both the high value of content contracts to publishers and the high price we have to pay to maintain the paper-era intellectual property model online. Strong contentprotection would be valuable in going beyond indirect and partialviewing of content on servers, to viewing content directly and locally.The price is the loss of control over our own computers, and lossof privacy over our activities on those computers., The online content market is squeezed from above and below. Fromabove, by the ease of redistributing high-value content. Frombelow, by the mental transaction costs of charging for low valuecontent - costs to which the requirements of registration andtraceable identification add substantially. The size of themarket in between is an open question. "Information wants to befree", but authors and publishers want to be paid for it.The current content market for more difficult to copy media, such as books, films, CD-ROM, and so forth is large, in the hundreds ofbillions of dollars per year. But on the Internet, free contentdominates. Distributing ephemeral content in the form of service subscriptions is in most cases a more viable way to go.It remains to be seen how large the Internet contentmarket will become, and to what extent customers will tolerateimpositions on privacy and control of their computers in orderto obtain legal content., , Reputation relies on intermediaries to convey information.For example, credit rating agencies are used to minimize adverse selection (hidden knowledge) problems in credit., Reputation can be viewed as the amount of trust an agent has created for himself [ 14 ]. Reputation systems ultimately need to be based on fact rather than mere opinion or faith to be effective. For example, if we are to have a good credit rating system, we need to be confident that the credit record assembled by the agency is sufficiently accurate. Reputation information is typical gathered and distributed by intermediaries trusted to perform this task. , An important and general problem seems to be that of tagging a negativebehavior source for future recognition. The tag might be used for negativeinformation shared publically (e.g., credit ratings) or kept private (e.g.,kill files). The behavior source might be non-human (e.g., recognizing viruspatterns for the purposes of virus scanning). Where the behavior sourceis adaptable and self-interested, it has an incentive to spoof the tagging:a debtor to change names to avoid paying his debt, a virus to scrambleits pattern to avoid scanning, and so on. If the tag carries a greaterpositive reputation (where zero is the reputation of a newcomer) this incentiveis lost and the negative side of the reputation must be borne. , Can digital credentialling systems facilitate such negative reputationhandling? , Service-specific, or local, name reputation may not be able to accomplishsuch tracking of negative reputation. If a local name accumulates more negativethan positive credentials, it can simply be replaced by a newcomer localname for this service, without harming the positive reputation capital ofthe other behavior source local names. Hostile sources can continuouslyspoof innocent newcomers. Counterparties lose the ability to determinea history of previous hostile behavior - kill files, virus scanning,credit ratings, and so on fail. , Chaumian credentialsalso give the credential holder control over the transfer of credentialsbetween his local names, creating an incentive to show positive credentialsand hide negative ones. To remedy this, counterparties can demand "non-negativecredentials" (in a form such as, "Alice in many transactionsrecorded by me in area X has never done bad things x,y,z"), Non-negativecredentials are limited to areas that can be well-tracked. One such maybe credit ratings, as long as one is doing the bulk of one's credit transactionsthrough is-a-person linked local names. , Where Chaumian credentials are inapplicable, we might raise the costof entry to be greater than that of a newcomer. This gives us two clearlydefined reputation points to compare on an otherwise rather subjectivescale: participation threshold and newcomer reputation. Both are subjectivein the eye of the party choosing whether or not to participate in an activitywith the name. , A participation threshold greater than newcomer reputation clashes withthe desirable goal, that one be able to make a fresh start. For that matter,unless previous names and their positive reputations are linked to theirnew names, the pioneers cannot make a start, so that the institution itselfcannot be started. Ditto for for institutional growth. , Tags that bundle the results of a wide variety of transactions - globalnames, or universal IDs, or "True Names" - seem to providethe most incentive for parties to carry their negative credentials. Mostpeople have accumulated enough positive reputation is some areas that itis well-nigh impossible for them to start over their entire lives as newcomers., A big problem arises with negative credentials when they are used, notmerely to avoid engaging in a particular activity with a party, but forretribution against that party. Retribution may take some nonviolent onlineform, such as slander, denial of service attack, and so on, but the mostworrisome form of retribution is a violent physical attack. Could we havedigital tags that, while tracking negative behavior sources through thedigital world, remain strictly unlinked to any kind of physical locationdata? Alas, we have several important systems, such as cellular phones,shipping addresses, etc. that provide such linkage. , Another problem for negative reputations is that "negative"is subjective. What is perfectly reasonable in one culture may bring adeath sentence in another. However, there are some important, well-definedtransactions where there is a widely agreed use of historical information.For example, for those who extend credit (and keep in mind, credit is implicitin most contracts), borrowers who have not paid their bills in the pastare universally a negative. Being on the receiving end of a computer virusis practically always a negative., The question may become one of deciding what of these three dimensionsare most important, and how they can be traded off: , Keep in mind too, that in practice these are evaluated primarily bya market evolving from its current state, rather than by abstract ethicalphilosophies. , Robin Hanson [ 15 ] has observed that in a world of global names, the use of alocal name may signal the hiding of negative credentials, so that the useof global names is in equilibrium. A further problem with local names isthat our relationships are often not neatly compartmentalizable into standardservice types, and even where they are we might like to expand them intonew areas. I suggest that, at minimum, we will want to reveal progressivelymore local names to our counterparties as our relationships with them becomecloser and more co-exposed. , While the global name equilibrium may hold for many of our relationships,there may be plenty of areas where theprivity benefits of localizing names outweigh the costs of being lessor unable to differentiate newcomers from hostiles. (By "privity"I refer the entire general task of protecting relationships from hostilethird parties; confidentiality and protection of property from theft aretwo examples of privity). For example, the preference-tracking serviceat www.firefly.com increases participation via the use of pseudonyms, andsuffers little exposure from hostiles. On the other hand, credit transactionstypically demand identifying information, because the contractual exposuretypically outweighs benefits of privity. , Global name public keys, which have many drawbacks in terms of privity,may be the best way to track negative reputation, but they are no panacea.There is an important conundrum in an ID-based key system: the conflictbetween the ability to get a new key when the old one is or could be abusedby another (key revocation), and the ability of another to be sure theyare dealing with the same person again. This may also provide an opportunityfor parties to selectively reveal positive credentials and hide negativeones. For example, a person with a bad credit rating could revoke the keyunder which that rating is distributed and create a new one, while selectivelyupdating their positive credentials to the new key (e.g., have their almamater create a new diploma). Key revocation authorities might combine forces with credit rating agencies to avoid such erasure of negative history, but this gives them even more centralized control- not merely over IDs but over important elements of reputation associatedwith those IDs. This further violates the principles of separation of powersand segregation of duties, providing added opportunity for fraudulent issueor revocation of IDs along with fraudulent communication of reputationinformation. , The current universal (non-cryptographic) key in the U.S., the social security number (SSN), is very difficultto revoke; it's much easier to change your name. This policyis probably no accident, since the biggest economic win of global name identification is the tracking of negative reputations, which revocation can defeat. Aslong as the SSN is a shared database key, not used for the purpose of securelyidentifying a faceless transaction, there is little need for revocationbeyond the undesired erasure of negative history. Combining a secret authenticationkey, which must be revocable, with a public universal ID is quite problematic., In current practice, there are several partially effective processes for ensuring future performance: , * Reputation (especially credit reports): often effective, but onlyto a point, as it is often hard for the debtor to accurately judge thefuture reputational effects of an action (e.g., failure to pay a bill, takingout too large a loan, etc.) that has clear, local, beneficial effects today.There is more imbalance in knowledge between current and distant consequencesamong individual consumers, but even among large organizations with highcredit ratings it is not an irrelevant factor. , * Secured transactions: liens, escrow, etc., * Garnishment of future income , * Law enforcement, especially to enforce transfer of control over lienedassets, garnishment, etc. , These processes have a fundamental property in common - they violatethe privity of credit transactions - in other words, they bring in third parties to track reputations or enforce repayment. Do credit transactions entail a fundamental imbalance in incentives that can only be redressed by bringing in third parties, or can the security protocolsbe discovered which allow credit with minimal or no third party involvement?, , In turn, Peter Swire [ 17 ] describes two problems facing inadequatelysecured or unsecured loans to "credit names":, Adverse selection: Prior deadbeats can start fresh by signing up for the new service. Going in, it will be biased in favor of deadbeats. This problem may be addressed by using Chaumian credentials. These allow theestablished positive reputations of previous names to be carried over to the credit name, without allowing anyone to link the two names.Entrants without positive reputations can be rejected., The endgame problem: A credit name can establish a good credit rating over time. When the limit is high enough, the borrower can quickly spend it all. A malicious borrower, with a good rating established under a previous name, can systematically profit at the expense of the lender, if the throw-away value is greater than the replacement cost.To address this problem, creditors will have to charge higher rates to new credit names and raise credit limits more slowly than for traceable names.  Honest borrowers will subsidize the dishonest, to an even greater extentthan they do in the current credit card system., , Secured credit need not violate privity if the physical control overthe securing property can be shared. So that, for example, automobile creditcan be secured as long as repossession is possible, as described in theexample above. , A standard mechanism of secured credit applicable online is theescrow. An escrow is an intermediary trusted to hold messagesuntil messages from both sides are received, and, optionally,their contents verified - to extent the content is verifiable,and at the expense of some privity. The escrow then sends themessages off to their recipients, along with receipts. Messages can contain any sort of data: content, a bearer certificate, etc., , Alice wants a New York City cab ride for which she's willing to pay$100, but she doesn't trust Bob the taxi driver to get her there on timeif she pays up front. Bob in turn doesn't trust Alice to pay at the endof the trip. Commerce can be consummated by Alice tearing a $100 bill andgiving half to Bob. After the trip she gives the other half to Bob, whichhe can then reassemble into a negotiable $100 bill. Alice loses her incentiveto not pay. Bob gains incentive to get her there on time as promised. Bothhave made what economists call a "credible commitment" to performtheir respective parts of the contract.  Markus Jacobsson has digitized this idea, coming up with a protocol for ripped digital cash. As with many other aspects of digital cash, the idea can be generalized to rip bearer certificates of any kind. If the transfer is double-blinded the transfer agent has no knowledge of the participants and therefore no bias to favor one over the other. The transfer agent must, however, be able to assess proof of performance, and the protocol is only workable where such proof (in the form of proof of receipt of a message, for example) is available., The ripped bill is similar to using the transfer agent as an escrow agent. An advantage over using an escrow agent is that theneed for extra anonymous channels between the parties and the escrow isavoided. A disadvantage is that the transfer agent now has taken on themajor additional job of acting as an adjudicator, assessing proofs of performance(or at the very least, must be responsible for subcontracting out thisjob and implementing the adjudicator's judgement)., , Credit cards provide relatively little protection from thirdparties, especially in the area of privacy, but they do have an interesting contractual feature worth noting, the chargeback. With chargebacks customers can get refunds on allegedly unwanted merchandise.   The issuer tracks the number of chargebacks both for customers and merchants;too many chargebacks can get you booted out of the system. This provides an efficient mechanism for refunds without resorting to expensive tortproceedings. Many customers who read the fine print or otherwise learn about chargeback limits often do chargebacks despite receiving andenjoying the merchandise; there is no practical way for the issuerto detect such fraud, and so it can only be pruned by limitingthe number of chargebacks per customer. Some merchants complain vociferously about such customer "theft", and it seems to makepossible coordinated attacks to put merchants out of business,but nevertheless merchants sign up for credit cards, because that's what their customers have signed up for. The chargeback feature makes customers morecomfortable purchasing goods of unknown quality, especially mail-orderand over the Internet. Chargeback provides a crude but effective partial solution to the information asymmetry problem between retailers and consumers.  , , Tim May [ 18 ] has proposed a "time release" form of money that becomesgood only after a certain date. "Interval money"; that would expireafter a certain date has also been proposed. These can be implementedby a digital mint expiring or activating special issues of digital cash,or by a third party issuing escrowed keys at specific times. Since thesekeys are encrypted against the escrow agent, and that agent doesn't knowwhat they will be used for, the escrow agent has no incentive to cheat.A generalization of this is that transfer and redeemability are each associated with interval sets, or validity periods when each can and cannot be performed. This is analogous to clipping coupons on bonds., , Wei Dai and Hal Finney [ 19 ] have proposed a loan mix, to unlinkborrowers from amount borrowed. The identity of the potentialborrowers is still public, as well as the system for enforcing payment, but the actual amount loaned or borrowed remains unknown. The system starts with participants putting unknown amounts into a pot and getting receipts (bearer bonds) for these amount. All participants then borrow a standard amount. Whether a participant is a net borrower or a net creditor, and of what amount, remains private. When the loan is due all participants repay the standard amount, and the creditors reclaim the amounts on their bearer bonds. The amount actually borrowed (or, if negative, loaned) is the public amount borrowed minus the amount put into the pot. One consequence is that while negativereputations can still be accumulated when participants failto pay back the standard amount, positive reputationsare minimal, since participants who borrow and loan are indistinguishable.If future creditors put stock in positive participation, one couldgain a credit rating by perpetually participating as a net borrowerof zero, by loaning and borrowing the same amounts., , Smart contracts combine protocols, users interfaces, and promises expressed via those interfaces, to formalize and secure relationships over public networks. This gives us new ways to formalize the digital relationships which are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. Smart contracts reduce mental and computational transaction costs, imposed by either principals, third parties, or their tools. , Mark Miller [ 20 ] foresees that the law of the Internet, and the devicesattached to it, will be provided by a grand merger of law and computer security. If so, smart contracts will be a major force behind this merger., , is a Computer Science graduateof University of Washington.

In my old essay on micropayments and mental transaction costs, besides pointing out that mental transaction costs were a far more important barrier to Internet micropayments than computational transaction costs, I sketched some ideas for tools to lower mental transaction costs. Lowering mental transaction costs enables pricing at finer granularity, which increases price-sensitive behavior and thus the efficient allocation of scarce resources. I also used electricity conservation as a practical example of how mental transaction costs pose a barrier to price flexibility and thus to conservation. It turns out that electricity conservation is among the first areas to benefit from smart contracts that lower mental transaction costs.This paper I presented at the Second Berlin Internet Economics Workshop in 1999 provides more detail on the economic theory behind mental transaction costs. Basically, mental transaction costs are the "hassle factor" one experiences when spending money: the costs of translating one's own knowledge and preferences into buying decisions. Mental transaction costs pose a severe limit on the efficiency of markets in general and on useful price granularity in particular; they are the main reason consumers generally prefer flat-rate pricing and why high price granularity (and thus micropayment) is usually useless.Tools to lower mental transaction costs have vast potential but present many problems, especially "determining what the parties want in the first place." The most promising tools are smart contracts -- computerized devices that respond to the environment according to price signals or other contractual terms, customer preferences, and other states or events that are encoded in them or that they are encoded to respond to. Many smart contracts in the future may be programmed using a contract drafting language for specifying their event-driven behavior.(I have also emphasized making smart contracts securely self-enforcing or self-verifying, but that is a different topic from this post, which deals with the role of smart contracts in lowering mental transaction costs).Mental transaction costs pose a barrier to any scheme to go from flat rate to variable pricing in order to conserve resources. Such a scheme may be made possible only by technological or institutional breakthroughs which lower mental transaction costs. Faruqui and Earle[1]'s description of California's Demand Response scheme for peak-demand pricing of electricity is generally a good description of a successful and promising program that increases conservation and reduces the danger of blackouts by going from flat pricing to three price tiers (off-peak, peak, and critical peak). But the article fails to recognize the important role of mental transaction costs when increasing the number of price tiers. The authors do, however, recognize two important success factors. The importance of these factors provides strong evidence that mental transaction costs and tools that save on these costs will crucial in determining the scope and success of California's demand-sensitive pricing scheme. The authors observed that "[o]n average, residential customers reduced peak loads on critical days by 13.1 percent." The reduction was much larger for customers with central air conditioning. More interesting still, customers with "automatic price-sensitive thermostats" saved twice as much energy as customers that did not have these smart contract devices.[2]The first effect comes about because on average each central air unit consumes far more power than each window unit; correspondingly the same mental transaction costs expended in controlling the thermostat of the former saves far more energy and thus money than controlling the latter. The second effect comes because the price-sensitive thermostat is a specialized smart contract that allows for simple input preferences (a simple table of preferred temperature at each of three to five price levels depending on the contract) and then runs automatically. It thus fulfills (for this particular function) my hopes of using simple user interfaces to input preferences into smart contracts which then make purchases automatically, thereby reducing the the mental transaction costs otherwise imposed by multi-tier pricing.In its most general form, a smart contract will have a market translator that specifies a purchasing or selling action based on a function of current budget, environmental variables, and current and predicted (e.g. according to rational expectations models) prices:transaction_decision = f(preferences, budget, environment, prices, price model)That general description makes it all rather complicated; in practice there will be quite simplified versions based on simple versions of a subset of these variables that work in particular niches where those variables dominate preferences. An example of this simplicity is the "automatic price-sensitive thermostats" mentioned above. Programming this thermostat is only a bit more complicated than a normal thermostat: one programs in multiple temperatures each corresponding to a price level. For example, at an off-peak charge of 9 cents/kilowatt*hour, the summer air conditioning thermostat might be set to 72 degrees, while the normal peak price of 22 cents might be set to 74 degrees and the critical peak price (the hottest days when California would without substantial conservation otherwise be in danger of blackout) of 60 cents set to 77 degrees. So you input three settings instead of one. Presumably when you want to change the settings you can do it one at a time or change all three at a time by the same amount. That takes substantially more effort than a normal thermostat, but the California experiment showed that where the overall use controlled by that thermostat is great enough and the price differential high enough, it's worth the effort.A bit more generally, a preference for physical state of the world can be specified by specifying a functionpreferred_state = f(current price)The thermostat then, like any thermostat, purchases electricity based on the functionif actual_state > preferred_state then purchase (turn on consumption)else don't purchase (turn off consumption)(Reverse to "Offline References:[1] Ahmad Faruqui and Robert Earle, "Demand Response and Advanced Metering," Regulation v. 29 n. 1 (Spring 2006).[2] Id. at pg. 25.

A few months ago I updated my paper on the origins of money.   There are a number of ideas in here involving transaction cost economics and evolutionary psychology, with evidence from anthropology and archaeology.  The article updates and critiques Carl Menger's theory of the origin of money.
The false dichotomy between "state" (or "goverment") and "anarchy" can be highlighted every time someone tries to come up with a coherently stated definition of either of these supposed opposites. If we take, for example, Hans-Hermann Hoppe's definition literally, a federalist system of governments like the United States is not a "state" at all, nor are a wide variety of other political systems that have or could exist that could hardly be called "anarchies".  Here's Hoppe:Let me begin with the definition of a state. What must an agent be able to do to qualify as a state? This agent must be able to insist that all conflicts among the inhabitants of a given territory be brought to him for ultimate decision-making or be subject to his final review. In particular, this agent must be able to insist that all conflicts involving himself be adjudicated by him or his agent. And implied in the power to exclude all others from acting as ultimate judge, as the second defining characteristic of a state, is the agent's power to tax: to unilaterally determine the price that justice seekers must pay for his services. [Source] I'm not trying to pick on anarchists like Hoppe here. Statist political scientists and politicians also oversimplify the world of politics and law with this false dichotomy.  This usually takes the form of observing that modern governments have feature X, and by two invalid steps of logic (that X is necessary for government and that without such government there is only lawless anarchy) concluding that anyplace lacking feature X would be a lawless anarchy.  "Anarchy" is thus used as a boogyman to justify all sorts of brutality, waste, and other wrongs perpetrated by modern governments.Let's start here:This agent must be able to insist that all conflicts among the inhabitants of a given territory be brought to him for ultimate decision-making or be subject to his final reviewThe United States federal government does not "insist that all conflicts among the inhabitants of a given territory be brought to [it] for ultimate decision-making", nor even that all disputes are "subject to [its] final review." Most disputes occur under State and local law, and the final arbiters of State law are State supreme courts. Only in the minority of cases where a dispute raises a question of federal law, or involves people from multiple states, do federal courts assert jurisdiction. Nor, of course, do States hold an all-encompassing monopoly of power -- many issues instead come under local or federal jurisdiction. Furthermore, federal, State, and local governments all have overlapping powers of taxation.Now it might be argued that some provisions of federal law, for example in the Constitution, are so ambiguous as to effectively allow federal courts to assert jurisdiction whenever they strongly desire to do so.  To the extent that there is merit in this argument, it only creates a conflict of interest because federal courts are able to judge the scope of their own power:In particular, this agent must be able to insist that all conflicts involving himself be adjudicated by him or his agent.Hoppe indeed identifies a serious defect in modern constitutions -- they violate the ancient common law maxim that no one should be a judge in his own case. But this defect is readily cured without the kind of radical from-scratch destruction and reconstruction of law and politics that the term "anarchy" suggests. The reforms needed to cure this defect (described in more detail here) are (1) selecting judges by a method completely independent of the other political branches, so that in no real sense would judges and those in other branches that they judge be agents of the same entity, or one the agent of the other, and (2) by reform of jurisdiction, for example by changing who has jurisdiction over constitutional questions. If federal courts were not selected by Presidents and Senates whose power they then judge, and if federal courts reviewed disputes involving state constitutions, and a super-federal court reviewed disputes involving the federal Constitution, so that they did not have final say over the scope of their own power, conflicts of interest of the kind that Hoppe rightly criticizes in modern governments would no longer commonly arise.What Hoppe is really arguing against can more accurately be called "sovereignty", the idea of one entity with a monopoly over all coercive powers in a territory, than "state" or "government." There are plenty of configurations of coercive power, in fact most such configurations over most of history, that do not involve this kind of sovereignty. In highlighting the problems of sovereignty I quite agree with him, but observe that the United States and many other historical and current polities are or were not "sovereign" in this sense, and many historical entities (such as the system of political property rights over most of English history) were not even close.Those of us who would like to greatly reduce the brutal and wasteful powers of modern governments do ourselves a great disservice by adopting the statist term "anarchist."  Anarchy is the boogyman of statists.  A libertarian calling himself an "anarchist" is like an agnostic or atheist calling himself a "Satanist."  Seek not for imaginary opposites, but for real alternatives.
COSMOS magazine of Australia is teaming up with the Australian national government and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and NASA in the United States to send a ream of messages gathered from the public via the JPL-run Deep Space Network (on which I once worked) to the nearby star system of Gliese 581, which includes the recently discovered extrasolar planet Gliese 581d.  The schedule is to send the messages on Friday, August 28th.  According to COSMOS's editor, Wilson da Silva, Yes, it is a "stunt": the purpose is to engage the public during Science Week in Australia and get them thinking about the big questions: are we alone, is life common in the universe, how often does intelligent life arise, how big is space, etc etc.It will apparently also be good for COSMOS' advertising and subscription revenue:So far, it has been very successful: more than 1,000 newspapers and other media have published online stories all over the world, it has been featured on 9,000 blogs and more than 1.17 million pages of the site have been read in the past 10 days.I can't say whether it will hurt or harm the quests of the government agencies and contractors involved for more taxpayer money.Alas, this admitted publicity stunt gets the public thinking about "the big questions" in a way that is rather prejudiced about the answers.  The very act of sending a message to a specific star suggests to our newly attracted pupils that there is some substantial probability of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) at the other end, when astronomers have observed over 10 billion galaxies and have never seen any signs of ETI.  The odds of even one other ETI civilization in our galaxy, much less specifically around one of the two hundred billion stars in our galaxy, Gliese 581, are rather remote.  Just how remote we will now explore -- then we shall take a look at the prayers to Gliese 581d.The mindset at work with the COSMOS transmission is similar to those behind the web calculator Drake Equations that I've seen.   The Drake Equation supposedly brings together all the main probabilities relevant to calculating how many ETI we might expect to find in our galaxy: the expected number of habitable planets, the probability of the origin of life given a habitable planet, the probability of intelligence evolving given life, and so on.  You are supposed to be able to input your own assumptions into these calculators and it spits out the expected number of ETI in our galaxy based on these assumptions.  Real scientists actually observe the universe and fit their equations and parameters to what they see, rather than what they wish were true, but these "science education" sites invite the visitor to plug in what they wish -- unless it doesn't fit what the web site authors wish.From these sites we learn something very interesting, not about how science should be done or what it has observed, but about the hopes and wishes of their authors.  These calculators don't allow just any numbers to be placed in them, but only numbers within a range defined by the authors.  They don't even allow numbers to be placed into them that are most consistent with what astronomers have actually observed in the universe, i.e. the ubiquitous naturalness and lack of artificiality everywhere they look.  Let's use as an example the least pathological.A reasonable guess, given the improbability of actually existential threats between the invention of printing (with the permanence it brings to civilization) and the end of the universe, is that most casually connected series of civilizations will achieve a substantially >1 billion years lifetime.  (In other words, while many civilizations might rise and fall, and subsequent intelligent species might even replace prior ones, once a civilization achieves printing this causal chain of civilizations is unlikely to be permanently terminated, and will probably move beyond the home planet and within a few tens of millions of years spread across its home galaxy).  The largest value this calculator allows for average civilization lifetime is 1 billion years, but even putting in this too small value makes it impossible to put in at least one other value consistent with our observations.  (Update: since I wrote this section on the Drake calculator for a private list a few months ago, they've updated the calculator and it now supports lifetimes up to 5 billion years, but the other limitations remain).Astronomers have looked far and wide in the skies, builders and miners and geologists and archaeologists have dug and examined millions of places on our own planet, and have seen neither any alien civilization, nor even their remains, on or near our planet or anywhere in our galaxy.  They would likely have long since spread across our galaxy by now, a process that would take only a few tens of millions of years.  They would have blotted out the stars to keep their energy from going to waste. Our observations of other galaxies -- with extremely few galaxies deeply moved into the infrared consistent with a space-faring civilization efficiently harvesting the energy of its stars -- strongly suggest that the number of civilizations is far less than 1 per galaxy.  The naturally rare molecules used in the artificial surfaces of these massive constructions would also stand out in spectra against the naturally common molecules in dust clouds, planetary nebulae, etc. that astronomers actually observe.But even sticking with the order of magnitude of between 0.1 and 1 per galaxy, this "model" does not allow the input of values consistent with both this order of magnitude and with what we observe about life on our own planet.One has to put the minimum allowed for both the fraction of habitable planets with life the fraction of inhabited planets that achieve intelligent life to achieve this order of magnitude. Based on the commonality of near-intelligence life on our planet the latter number is probably much higher than the minimum allowed value 1/10^6.   Based on the extremely improbable genetic complexity of even the simplest known self-sufficient microbial ecosystem, the former number is probably much lower than 1/10^6.  But the program prevents input of these kinds of values most consistent with our observations.Other Drake calculators I have looked at are far worse still in not allowing the most reasonable values to be placed into the Drake Equation.   They are not teaching science -- numerology, or here we might call it Bayesiology, is not science -- they are selling a belief, the belief that our galaxy is filled with morally advanced beings that we can talk to.  How are these grossly misleading "educational tools" and publicity stunts like COSMOS helpful in teaching the questions of "are we alone, is life common in the universe, how often does intelligent life arise, how big is space, etc."?COSMOS An Enid News & Eagle piece republished by COSMOS invokes another prejudiced cliche of the SETI (Search for ETI) crowd: ETI living in a heavenly utopia:  Me [Human interviewer]: "... So you don’t elect leaders?  Then who keeps you safe?”  Bleem: “From what?”  Me: “From criminals, from other countries that declare  war on you.”  Bleem: “Explain criminals.”  Me: “People who steal other people’s things or hurt  them. Some even kill other people.”  Bleem: “Explain steal.”  Me: “Taking things that don’t belong to you.”  Bleem: “Explain kill.”  Me: “To terminate one’s existence.”This nonsense neatly avoids an important question Drs. Jared Diamond and David Brin  have raised -- if, per COSMOS' assumption that ETI is common, these creatures, likely far more ancient and powerful than humans, do receive our message and thereby discover us, may that not put humanity in severe danger?   Instead of "shouting at the cosmos", shouldn't we put reasonable restrictions on the power, focus, and targets of transmissions until we learn whether and what kinds of threats might exist?  (I realize Gliese 581 probably doesn't raise this issue, because being within about 20 light-years they would probably have already detected our oxygen spectra, our "I Love Lucy" and "Seinfeld" broadcasts, our nuclear tests, and much else, but the [update: COSMOS' own, as well as the EN&E's] article[s], supposedly an exercise in education, doesn't even raise the issue and explain this).  By blithely ignoring this issue while it sends the messages, COSMOS again answers the question with extreme prejudice by assuming it is safe.   They even have a theological justification: ETI wouldn't harm a flea, because the only thing these innocents can understand is their seraphic utopia.  Apparently no living thing up there in the heavens eats any other living thing -- our ETI are puzzled by the very concept of "kill".  Our beatific interlocutors were apparently created by an onmniscient and omnibenevolent god to dwell together in heavenly communal bliss rather than evolved through Darwinian evolution.   Children of Australia, there's your biology lesson for the day.COSMOS has rejected "inappropriate" messages to Gliese 581d, but it does not describe what its criteria for "inappropriate" might be.  How can any of us humans predict the reaction to any given message of a genetically completed unrelated creature, even assuming it exists, in a culture about which we know absolutely nothing?  COSMOS has no basis for deciding that any stupid or insulting message, and there are plenty of stupid and insulting messages that they let through, is better than any other, besides their own particular human 21st century Australian reactions.Many submitters are sending normal chatty messages, while some are quite properly treating the whole thing as a joke, but it is worth thinking abut how closely many of the messages in this "science" project resemble prayers (all errors in the original):"I hope when you recieve these messages that you will come and visit and bring a new age to the human race. LIVE LONG AND PROSPER.""All things work together for good.""We're live in one universe,so we just like a family.We can share our happy with you.""We are so small.""Please help us to stop the obesity problem that haunts our world!""Please come visit us on Earth as soon as you can.We've been waiting a long time to see you.Don't make us wait any longer! LIVE LONG & PROSPER!!!""I know we are not alone.You are watching us.""Don't let humans colonize habitable extrasolar planets, contact us before then please. Thanks for not colonizing Earth long ago and allowing humans to evolve.""Bring some peace to the earth.""I am told if you say something to the universe it may come true.""We know that we are not alone,hope to hear from you.""Your technologies must be advanced than humans by millons of years.let us share all good things and we shall be friends.""Hello God, are you there?"And that's just from the first page of messages.  These interstellar tweets that COSMOS collected and NASA obligingly plans to send via its Deep Space Network to Gliese 581, the earlier "Teen Message" sent by Dr. Alexander Zaitsev and his team from the Evpatoria dish in the Ukraine, and the Drake calculators that invite you to believe that your wishes are scientifically true, unless they disagree with the authors', are exercises, not in science education, but in "educating" the public in the tenets of an often twisted faith.
Here is the silly patent.  But it's more entertaining when the laser pointer is wielded by hand (which from reading the claims you can see does not infringe the patent).
One of the big engineering advantages of outer space is that microgravity allows for very large structures. First, however, one must figure out how to deploy the structure.  Here's an interesting new approach.
In "The Playdough Protocols" I described how ancient Sumerians used tamper evidence both in the form of physical seals and in the form of tamper evident numbers, in particular checksums.  These are forerunners both of modern plastic sealing (used for evidence bags, in banking to store and transport cash and other valuables, to protect food from tampering, and so on) and modern cryptographic hash functions, whereby one can detect whether digital content has been altered.Daniel Nagy has uncovered a more particular connection between ancient auditing techniques and modern cryptography.   He writes how Chinese merchants, at least as far back as the 3rd century A.D., used remainders of division by prime numbers instead of checksums to ensure that nothing had been stolen from storage or cargo. The security of the Chinese system was based on what we still call the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  The theorem is also used in some modern cryptographic systems based on the difficulty of factoring, and in particular the RSA scheme for decryption and digital signatures.
Given that I subscribe to the law of the dominant paradigm, I have a soft spot in my heart for ideas that haven't gotten the attention they deserve. I try to choose such ideas to blog on. But I can't give all such ideas that I know of the necessary attention. Here are some:Richard Dawkins himself is by now overexposed, but in his quest to convert the world to the atheist meme he, along with most of the rest of the world, has neglected his own theory of the extended phenotype. Like the metaphor of the selfish gene, this is an insight with many very important consequences. So far we've just scratched the tip of this iceberg.Yoram Barzel is one of the most important economists of the last half century, but few people know this. Along with the much more famous Friedrich Hayek, Barzel is probably the economist who has influenced me the most. He has had a number of important insights related to transaction costs which I've confirmed repeatedly in my own observations and readings in economic history. Probably his most important insights relate to the importance and nature of value measurement. (“Measurement Cost and the Organization of Markets,” Journal of Law and Economics, April 1982 Reprinted in The Economic Foundations of Property Rights: Selected Readings, SPejovich, ed., Edward Elgar Publishing Company, 1997. And in Transaction costs and Property rights, Claude Menard, Editor, Edward Elgar publishing Company, 2004.) Another is his analysis of waiting in line (queuing) versus market prices as two methods of rationing. Waiting in line is the main means of rationing in a socialist economy but is surprisingly widespread even in our own. (“A Theory of Rationing by Waiting,” Journal of Law and Economics, April 1974 Reprinted in Readings in Microeconomics, Breit, Hochman, and Sauracker, 3rd ed., 1986).Advanced cryptography over the last twenty-five years has come with a large number of important protocols. Public key encryption got all the hype, but it was just a warm-up. Alas, the perceived esoteric nature of the field and magical function of its protocols has apparently intimidated regular programmers away from implementing most of them. Appearances to the contrary they are based on solid math, not magic. I've blogged on some of these, but there is far more out there waiting to be picked up by mainstream computer security. Of all the advanced cryptography protocols secure time-stamping and multiparty secure computation are probably the most important.The ideas of voluntary oblivious compliance and admonition systems from the capability security community. These are very useful in elucidating interelationships between wet protocols (e.g. manual procedures and law) and security. (By contrast I think capability security itself, and indeed the entire area of access control, is over-hyped: there are important roles for such things, for example in internal corporation access control, secure operating systems, and services where trust by all parties in corporate systems administrators is satisfactory, but they are nowhere close to being the be-all and end-all of distributed computing as often seems to be implied. Rather it's advanced cryptography where the most important advances in distributed security lie).The whole topic of franchise jurisdiction, crucial to understanding medieval and Renaissance English law, has nevertheless long been almost completely neglected. It is also a very different paradigm of the power of courts that has been forgotten by the modern legal and political communities in favor of the Roman model of governmental sovereignty.Almost any topic that requires knowledge from more than one academic specialty has been overly neglected: so much so that most such topics don't even exist but should.The specific ideas mentioned are just the tip of the iceberg of underappreciated topics. Please let me know what ideas you think have been the most underappreciated. There are, I'm sure, many, many ideas out there that I should know about but don't.
Cell phones can be used to monitor and pay for parking.  This system and this one are pretty clumsy in terms of all the gratuitous user input required, but as has occurred with prepaid cell phones I expect this to become quite a bit more user-friendly in the future. It will be very nice to be able to top up the parking meter without having to return to the car.As usual remember that any information recorded (here, where and when you park) "can and will be used against you." For example it can generally be subpoenad for use in court, as also occurs with credit card records, phone records, and automated toll systems.  My old boss David Chaum, his student Stefan Brands, and others in the advanced cryptography community have designed many protocols that would preserve privacy in these scenarios, but the deployers of these technologies are usually not terribly interested in your privacy. Your recourse -- keep using physical cash, and take the trouble to go back to your car to check and stuff your parking meter.In my original writing on smart contracts I talked about trading derivatives and constructing synthetic assets with low transaction costs:Very complex term structures for payments (ie, what payments get made when, the rate of interest, etc.) can now be built into standardized contracts and traded with low transaction costs, due to computerized analysis of these complex term structures. Synthetic assets allow us to arbitrage the different term structures desired by different customers, and they allow us to construct contracts that mimic other contracts, minus certain liabilities. As an example of the latter, synthetic assets have been constructed that mimic the returns of stocks in German companies, without requiring payment of the tax foreigners must pay to the German government for capital gains in German stocks. A bit later I figured out that the primary barrier to such activity is mental transaction costs. These costs throw a monkey wrench into what is otherwise the very good idea of consumer derivatives. One can imagine a wide variety of consumer derivatives, such as buying insurance against air fare changes and the growing business of selling sports tickets based on personal seat licenses (PSLs).   I have sketched some possible solutions to the mental transaction problem, such as the market translator. The main problem is designing an automated agent that can figure out user preferences without bothering the user -- usually by recording and analyzing the user's normal behavior. If this can be fully automated the bottom drops out, so to speak, and even nanobarter becomes possible.Smart contracts, based on digital property, open up a vast new space of possibilities. Many of the digital machines you own can obtain good information about your usage and their own status, from which they could at least crudely estimate what you want to buy. Take parking, for example. A suitably smart car and parking meter system should be able to figure out where you want to park and how much you want to pay for it, with minimal user intervention. I'm not talking anything like "AI" here, just computerized cars and parking meters that have sufficient sensors, can communicate with each other, and use known algorithms.  As you are driving down the street, you tell your car that you want to find a parking place.  The price of open parking spots ahead starts popping up on your dashboard. You choose and agree to pay the fee by simply parking in the spot.Along with this future urban lifesaver, parking spot derivatives would be very useful. For the same reasons as stadium owners sell PSLs -- to receive revenue up-front to help pay the cost of building the infrastructure -- owners of parking spaces could sell parking space licenses (PSL again, oops :-). The owner of the PSL, in turn -- or said owner's car acting as his agent -- could sell the hours or minutes that the car is not using. You could buy a PSL and thereby reserve that sweet spot right next to your downtown office for the year. Then sell off the parking rights for the weekends. You could reserve a spot next the your favorite club and sell off all the times except Thursday through Saturday night. And if you are away from the office or staying in for the evening, your car's market translator can price and offer the space and it will become open and start popping up on driver's dashboards.This kind of thing is just the tip of the iceberg as far as the potential of smart contracts is concerned.Finally I will report on a digital cash system from no less than our frequent commentor Daniel Nagy.  Nagy makes the following observation:While everyone with a cellular or a touch-tone telephone, a web-browser or email client in its readily available, out-of-box configuration is able to transmit short messages (up to a few hundred bits), performing complex calculations involving strong asymmetric cryptography requires additional tools which not everyone possesses or can afford to run. The fact that it is impossible to transact without performing complex calculations in real time is a far more serious obstacle than the need to contact the issuer for each transaction.This is an interesting approach, but I suspect may be correct only in the limited sense that these devices and software don't come built-in with the particular cryptographic protocols needed for strongly private cash (e.g. Chaumian blinding). But they don't come built-in with digital cash software either. Thus, the main advantage of Nagy's scheme, which may or may not make up for its reduced privacy features, comes from the ability to use it without having to install any extra software at all -- to just, for example, cut and paste the cash from an e-mail where you received it from one person to an e-mail where you pay it to another. Your word processor can be your wallet. If this is an important use-case, then Nagian cash may succeed where Chaumian cash failed.Another payment system of note is WebMoney, which recently started up a gold-backed currency, a competitor to the troubled e-gold.

Beware of what I call Pascal's scams: movements or belief systems that ask you to hope for or worry about very improbable outcomes that could have very large positive or negative consequences. (The name comes of course from the infinite-reward Wager proposed by Pascal: these days the large-but-finite versions are far more pernicious).  Naive expected value reasoning implies that they are worth the effort: if the odds are 1 in 1,000 that I could win $1 billion, and I am risk and time neutral, then I should expend up to nearly $1 million dollars worth of effort to gain this boon. The problems with these beliefs tend to be at least threefold, all stemming from the general uncertainty, i.e. the poor information or lack of information, from which we abstracted the low probability estimate in the first place: because in the messy real world the low probability estimate is almost always due to low or poor evidence rather than being a lottery with well-defined odds:(1) there is usually no feasible way to distinguish between the very improbable (say, 1 in 1,000) and the extremely improbable (e.g., one in a billion). Poor evidence leads to what James Franklin calls "low-weight probabilities", which lack robustness to new evidence. When the evidence is poor, and thus robustness of probabilities is lacking, then it is likely that "a small amount of further evidence would substantially change the probability. "  This new evidence is as likely to decrease the probability by a factor of X as increase it by a factor of X, and the poorer the original evidence, the greater X is.  (Indeed, given the nature of human imagination and bias, it is more likely to decrease it, for reasons described below).(2) the uncertainties about the diversity and magnitudes of possible consequences, not just their probabilities, are also likely to be extremely high. Indeed, due to the overall poor information, it's easy to overlook negative consequences and recognize only positive ones, or vice-versa. The very acts you take to make it into utopia or avoid dystopia could easily send you to dystopia or make the dystopia worse.(3) The "unknown unknown" nature of the most uncertainty leads to unfalsifiablity: proponents of the proposition can't propose a clear experiment that would greatly lower the probability or magnitude of consequences of their proposition: or at least, such an experiment would be far too expensive to actually be run, or cannot be conducted until after the time which the believers have already decided that the long-odds bet is rational. So not only is there poor information in a Pascal scam, but in the more pernicious beliefs there is little ability to improve the information.The biggest problem with these schemes is that, the closer to infinitesimal probability, and thus usually to infinitesimal quality or quantity of evidence, one gets, the closer to infinity the possible extreme-consequence schemes one can dream up,  Once some enterprising memetic innovator dreams up a Pascal's scam, the probabilities or consequences of these possible futures can be greatly exaggerated yet still seem plausible. "Yes, but what if?" the carrier of such a mind-virus incessantly demands.  Furthermore, since more than a few disasters are indeed low probability events (e.g. 9/11), the plausibility and importance of dealing with such risks seems to grow in importance after they occur -- the occurrence of one improbable disaster leads to paranoia about a large number of others, and similarly for fortuitous windfalls and hopes. Humanity can dream up a near-infinity of Pascal's scams, or spend a near-infinity of time fruitlessly worrying about them or hoping for them. There are however far better ways to spend one's time -- for example in thinking about what has actually happened in the real world, rather than the vast number of things that might happen in the future but quite probably won't, or will likely cause consequences very differently than you expect. So how should we approach low probability hypotheses with potential high value (negative or positive) outcomes?  Franklin et. al. suggest that "[t]he strongly quantitative style of education in statistics, valuable as it is, can lead to a neglect of the more qualitative, logical, legal and causal perspectives needed to understand data intelligently. That is especially so in extreme risk analysis, where there is a lack of large data sets to ground solidly quantitative conclusions, and correspondingly a need to supplement the data with outside information and with argument on individual data points."On the above quoted points I agree with Franklin, and add a more blunt suggestion: stop throwing around long odds and dreaming of big consequences as if you are onto something profound.  If you can't gather the information needed to reduce the uncertainties, and if you can't suggest experiments to make the hope or worry falsifiable, stop nightmaring or daydreaming already. Also, shut up and stop trying to convince the rest of us to join you in wasting our time hoping or worrying about these fantasies.  Try spending more time learning about what has actually happened in the real world.  That study, too, has its uncertainties, but they are up to infinitely smaller.
We are going to have to wait longer for the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion on the section 101 patentable subject matter jurisprudence of the last two decades, in which the Federal Circuit sharply diverged from Supreme Court precedent. That's because the Court dismissed LabCorp. v. Metabolite on a procedural "technical issue," namely LabCorp's failure to properly raise the section 101 issue at the original trial. Justice Breyer, joined by Stevens and Souter, wrote a strong dissent arguing that the case should be decided and the patent's claim to a "law of nature" held invalid. This dissent looks like a passing of the torch of section 101 enforcement from Stevens, the author of Parker v. Flook, to a new generation of justices. Breyer's opinion suggests that he at least vaguely recognizes the Neilson/Morse/Funk/Flook methodology, which the Federal Circuit has long rejected despite the many Supreme Court precedents, including Flook, that upheld it. I'll probably analyze Breyer's dissent in a subsequent post.It is unknown where the other justices stand on section 101, although it's probable that at least Ginsburg joined by some of the conservative justices would have agreed with the Federal Circuit's jurisprudence and argued based on dicta in Diamond v. Chakrabarty that "anything under the sun" can be patented. Instead, however, these justices agreed with the procedural dismissal and thus avoided making an argument that Metabolite's claim to (as the dissent accurately described it) "any test" combined with a "law of nature" was valid.I find that, although I agree with the substance of the dissent (claim 13 is invalid under section 101 as an attempt to patent a "law of nature," and it's not even a close call), I agree with the majority that this case should be dismissed for failure to properly raise the issue at trial level. Rather than specifically raise section 101, LabCorp engaged in vague hand-waving at the trial level. At the Federal Circuit level it made a 101-type argument and cited some 101 cases, but inexplicably still failed to directly cite section 101! It's grossly unfair and very costly to require already overburdened attorneys to respond to arguments that are poorly researched or amount to vague hand-waving, which is what LabCorp's implied section 101 arguments were here at the trial level and even to some extent at the Federal Circuit. LabCorp's failure to properly raise the issue allowed the Federal Circuit to completely ignore it, so that the Supreme Court was actually analyzing the 101 issue in this case for the first time, without proper fact-finding under section 101 below: something that it should be extremely loathe to do.
The American cousins Edward and Francis Bellamy had a rather baleful influence here in the States and elsewhere. The first is more infamous for his socialism, and the latter for his nationalism, but the duo were both essentially national socialists and we suffer under their legacy to this day.
"Cybercrime" statutes often create a very vague and broad prohibition (e.g. against "annoy[ing]" someone anonymously or pseudonymously, against "unauthorized" access to a computer, etc.)  For example, a bill recently hidden in a U.S. federal budget authorization and signed by the President makes it a crime for an Internet user to send or post a message on the Internet "without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy." Declan McCullough wrote this good layman's analysis of the new anti-Internet-annoyance law.  Declan's analysis has, however, been roundly criticized by legal scholars based in Washington D.C.Scholars who fear the Internet or favor arbitrary government power, or who out of excess love of authority wish to justify laws enacted from such motivations, typically give three kinds of arguments to justify these despicable mind police laws:(1) Don't worry about it, it was already the law.  For example, the above anti-annoyance law already applied to "telecommunications devices."  But if it's already the law, how is it any less useful to inform people that a law that already exists, but that they were probably not aware of it or at least of its implications, than to inform them of a new law?  And if it's already the law, why did whoever put the language into a bill feel the need to change it?  Eugene Volokh's markup of the bill's language (see below) demonstrates that, contrary to what some others have argued, the recent anti-annoyance bill has indeed changed the law for the Internet.(2) Dont' worry, "intent to X" is far more serious than the mere act with an effect of X and doesn't reach nearly as many people.  Unauthorized access is not per se culpable, but intent to gain unauthorized access is.  Being annoying is not culpable but intent to annoy is.  This avoids a basic question -- why should a state of mind be criminally culpable just because one of the results intended by that state of mind is a minor problem that occur quite often many people's or business's lives, such as unauthorized access or annoyance?  A law that proscribes a state of mind intending to commit the act implies that the result itself is so extreme that the criminal law should reach through the wires to reach it.  But Internet users are annoyed hundreds of millions of times a day.  There are millions of innoccous but unauthorized accesses per day.  These are nowhere close to the extremity of result required to render intending that result to be a criminal state of mind.  Furthermore, the law does not say "sole intent" to annoy.  This means that one can intend multiple things by an Internet message, but as long as one of those intentions, however minor, was to annoy a potential reader of the message, then under the plain meaning of the statute you are guilty of a crime.  Under the plain meaning of the new law, if you intend to mildly annoy and entertain andinform readers under a pseudonym, you a guilty of a crime.  If you intend to entertain and inform all readers and intend to annoy just a few potential readers (as has often occurred with politically valuable speech, for example with much pseudonymous speech in and related to The Federalist Papers), you are guilty of a crime, under the properly interpreted statute.(3) Don't worry, the courts won't really take the language seriously.  Daniel Solove, for example, argues "I'm certain that this [identity requirement] provision will be read narrowly to apply to individuals who intend to persistently or menacingly harass a person."  How can he be so certain?  Solove is putting a very large degree of trust in the courts to read a statute in a way that is very different from the plain meaning of the statute and in a way that violates a basic canon of legal interpretation, namely that when Congress adds a phrase to a list it must mean something that the other members of the list did not mean.  Congress must have added "annoy" because they meant to cover more states of mind than just intentions to "abuse, threaten, or harass."  Nor does Solove explain why a court would be compelled by law, rather than merely biased by an inclination to justice, to read the statute narrowly if the court feels strongly that it should not.  For example, the court may find the political opinions expressed in the speech beyond their pale and apply normal plain-meaning and common canon interpretation instead of Solove's method of ignoring the text.  Orin Kerr cites the First Amendment as a reason a court would read the statute narrowly, but doesn't explain why a court should not more properly apply the substantial overbreadth doctrine and throw out the entire clause, or at least the entire word "annoy," as facially unconstitutional.  Kerr by making this argument implies that there are many kinds of mind police prosecutions against an "intent to annoy" that fall short of an "intent to...harass" that he expects courts to find constitutional.   This implies the result Eugene Volokh pointed out using a different line of reasoning, that courts would be carving out a new exception to the First Amendment for online and phone speech.  Finally, neither Kerr nor Solove address the severe damage done to our legal system in terms of notice and rule of law when courts must throw plain meaning and standard canons of interpretation out the window in order to do justice.Unless we can trust the courts to severely restrict their scope or find them unconstitutional, these statutes are open invitations for prosecutors to attack almost any variety of Internet activity they don't like and that they think they can convince a judge or jury not to like.  Cybercrime statutes are generally not "laws" in the sense of "rule of law," but invitations to arbitrary bureaucratic dominion over almost any kind of Internet behavior, checked only by judges who wish to throw proper legal interpretation out the window (and, in the U.S., checked by juries).Here's the actual language (via Eugene Volokh) of the anti-pseudonymous-annoyance clause, with snuck-in revision that makes it apply to the Internet underlined:47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(C): Whoever ... in interstate or foreign communications ... makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications....(h)(1) The use of the term “telecommunications device” in this section --(A) shall not impose new obligations on broadcasting station licensees and cable operators covered by obscenity and indecency provisions elsewhere in this chapter; and(B) does not include an interactive computer service [= any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions].; and(C) in the case of subparagraph (C) of subsection (a)(1), includes any device or software that can be used to originate telecommunications or other types of communications that are transmitted, in whole or in part, by the Internet ....
A couple years ago I wrote this piece which links to a number of cases in which the United States Supreme Court has protected important rights of relationship.  Post-New Deal courts often make a phony distinction between "economic" relationships (which post-New Deal U.S. courts do not generally deem worthy of protection, despite many expressed and implied clauses in the U.S. Constitution to the contrary) and political and personal relationships, which are often and quite properly well-protected. An unprejudiced reading of the United States Constitution indicates that it was intended to strongly protect economic relationships as well as political and personal ones. Personal and political relationships are not strongly protected unless related economic relationships are strongly protected.  (Thus, for example, the right to use contraceptives under Griswold is phony if it does not include the right make contracts regarding contraceptives, for example the right of a drugstore to sell and a consumer to buy condoms). Furthermore, many relationships and statuses labeled "economic" have strong personal aspects.  For example, owning and living in a house usually includes important personal memories, privacy interests, and community ties. I will discuss this topic more in the future.
Caveat: As is with every post on this blog, this post is not legal advice.  If you want to make, use, sell, offer to sell, challenge, or otherwise legally entangle yourself with Amazon's patent, consult a good patent laywer (I'm not even one of those quite yet either).Peter Calveley from New Zealand has asked the United States Patent & Trademark Office to re-examine the validity of Amazon's infamous "one-click" patent.  One of the claims he is going after is Claim 11 which reads as follows:11. A method for ordering an item using a client system, the method comprising:displaying information identifying the item and displaying an indication of a single action that is to be performed to order the identified item; andin response to only the indicated single action being performed, sending to a server system a request to order the identified itemwhereby the item is ordered independently of a shopping cart model and the order is fulfilled to complete a purchase of the item.Calveley has made great use of the Wayback Machine  to dig up old documents.  Of particular interest is some of the old ecash(tm) documentation from DigiCash.  It's of particular interest to me because way back when I worked for six months for DigiCash as a contractor.Ecash was the first digital cash payment system to be deployed on the web.  Ecash deployed cutting-edge cryptography, in particular the blind signature which was one of the earliest patents for what was basically a pure algorithm.  I describe blind signatures here.However, it's not the cryptography that's important here, but how ecash interacted with the web to order a product.  The normal cycle of using ecash was as follows:(1) Click on a link or button on a web page to place an order with a merchant;(2) In response to this click the web server would (using a CGI script) start up the "shop" ecash software;(3) That software would contact the ecash client to request a payment;(4) The ecash client would pop up a screen to confirm a payment, and finally;(5) The user would click a button on the pop-up to confirm the order, and the order would be executed (the file delivered, the wager made, or whatever).This is a "two-click" process.  However, ecash had another feature, which I personally only dimly remember, and never associated with the notorious one-click patent until now.  But Calveley did make the link and has recovered the documentation for this feature.  With this feature the user could alter step 4 to automate the payment.  If a user trusted a merchant, he could configure the policy so that step 4 would not launch a pop-up, but would just go ahead and make the requested payment.  The result was a one-click ordering process. The combination of ecash automated payment policy with web ordering, which is at least strongly implied by the documentation Claveley has enearthed and almost surely was actually deployed and used in a one-click manner, reads on Amazon's claim 11 and some associated claims.Calveley is the first to point out, as far as I know, that the automated payment policy setting of ecash, combined with a single click to order an item (e.g. to download a file or to make a wager), is a very good prior art reference which anticipates the Amazon one-click patent (or at least makes it even more blindingly obvious than we software engineers already thought it was).If you have personal information or know of further documentation about this feature, or any other product or design prior to 1997 that used one-click ordering, both myself and Peter Claveley are greatly interested in collecting this information.Also, Claveley's going forward with the re-examination is contingent upon him collecting enough donations to recoup the $2,500 USPTO fee for a patent re-examination.

The Black Death, caused (as DNA testing of victims has recently confirmed)  by the bubonic plague, Yersina pestis, swept through Europe primarily in the years 1347-1351,  with some recurring outbreaks thereafter.  This plague not only brought great demographic changes to Europe, killing off probably about half of the population, but substantial changes to the economy and especially to the dominant sector of the economy then, agriculture.   The Black Death provides a great empirical test of Malthusian theories of agricultural economies and it is very informative to look at what happened.Under a naive reading of Malthusian theory, yield (the amount of food or fodder produced per unit area) should have improved after the Black Death: a lower population abandoned marginally productive lands and kept the better yielding ones.   Furthermore, the increased ratio of livestock to arable acres should have improved fertilization of the fields, as more nutrients and especially nitrogen moved from wastes (wild lands) and pastures to the arable.But while marginal lands were indeed abandoned (or at least converted from arable to pasture), and the livestock/arable ratio indeed increased, it's not the case that yield improved after the Black Death.  In fact, the overall (average) yield of all arable probably declined slightly, and the yields of particular plots of land that were retained as arable usually declined quite substantially.  Yields declined and for the most part stayed low for several centuries thereafter.   Other factors must have been work, factors stronger than the abandonment of marginally productive lands and the influence of more livestock on nutrient movement.Per capita agricultural output (vertical axis) vs. population density (horizontal axis) in England before, during, and after the Black Death and through the agricultural revolutions of the succeeding centuries.The main such factor is that increasing yield without great technological improvement requires more intensive labor: extra weeding, extra transport of manures and soil conditioners, etc.    Contrariwise, a less intensive use of land readily leads to falling yield.   After the Black Death, labor was more expensive relative to land, so it made sense to engage in a far less intensive agriculture.   The increase of pasture and livestock at the expense of the arable was a part of this.   But letting the yield decline was another.   What increased quite dramatically in the century after the Black Death was labor productivity and per capita standard of living (see first three points on the diagram, each covering an 80-year period from 1260 to 1499).Indeed, the whole focus in the literature on improvements in "productivity" as  yield in the agricultural revolution has been very misleading.  The crucial part of the revolution, and the direct cause of the release of labor from the agricultural to the industrial and transport sectors, was an increase in farm labor productivity: more food grown with less labor.   Over short timescales, that is without dramatic technological or institutional progress,  farm labor productivity was inversely correlated with yield for the reasons stated.   Higher labor productivity, certainly not higher yield, is what distinguished most of Europe for example from East and Southeast Asia, where under intensive rice cultivation, and abundant rain during warm summers, yield had long been far higher than in Europe.  Per Malthus, however, population growth in these regions had kept pace with yield, resulting in a highly labor-intensive, low labor productivity style of agriculture, including much less use of draft animals for farm work and transport.The bubonic plague was spread by rodents, who in turn fed primarily on grain stores.   This also had a significant impact on agriculture, because grain-growing farmers and grain-eating populations were disproportionately killed and people fled areas that grew or stored grain for regions specializing in other kinds of agriculture.    In coastal regions like Portugal there was a large move from grain farming to fishing.   In Northern Europe there was a great move to pasture and livestock, and in particular a relative expansion of the unique stationary pastoralism that had started to develop there in the previous centuries, both due to the relative protection of pastoralists from the plague and the less labor-intensive nature of pastoralism after land had become cheaper relative to labor.A final interesting effect is that the long trend from about the 11th to the 19th century in England of conversion of draft animals from oxen to horses halted temporarily in the century after the Black Death.  The main reason for this was undoubtedly the reversion of arable to pasture or waste (wild lands).    Oxen are, to use horse culture terminology, very "easy keepers".   As ruminants they can convert cellulose to glucose for energy and horses can't.  Oxen, therefore, became relatively cheaper than horses in an era with more wastes and less (or at least much less intensive use of) arable for growing fodder.  This kind of effect occurred again much later on the American frontiers where there was a temporary, partial reversion from horses to oxen as draft animals given the abundance of wild lands relative to groomed pasture and arable for growing fodder.   For example the famous wagon trains to California and Oregon were pulled primarily by oxen, which could be fed much better than horses in the wild grasslands and arid wastes encountered.   However in England itself, the trend towards horses replacing oxen, fueled by the increasing growth of fodder crops, had resumed by 1500 and indeed accelerated in the 16th century, playing a central role in the transportation revolutions of the 15th through 19th centuries.
Gregory Clark (via Marginal Revolution) has a new and more comprehensive data set on real wages in England from 1209 to the present. Up to about 1600, it is consistent with the Malthusian theory that real wages varied inversely with population. But then from at least 1630, there is a remarkable and unprecedented departure from the Malthusian curve formed by the ratio of real wages to population. Real wages rose over 50% from 1630 to 1690 despite rising population. There is then a stable period from 1730 to 1800 with a new curve parallel to but offset from the original Malthusian curve, and then a second startling departure from 1800 to today reflecting the end of this last Malthusian epoch (ironically just as Malthus was writing).This data contradicts the idea that nothing remarkable happened to the economy before the industrial revolution got going in the late 18th century. It also contradicts the theory that a qualitative shift occurred due the the Glorious Revolution of 1689 in which Parliament gained more power, some Dutch financial pratices were introduced, and soon thereafer the Bank of England founded.Rather, the theory that comes most readily to mind to explain an economic revolution in 17th century England is the rather un-PC theory of Max Weber. I'll get back to that, but first Clark debunks the theory of Becker et. al. regarding family investment. According to this theory, parents choose between the strategy of having a large number of children and having a small number of children in whom they invest heavily, teaching them skills. This is basically the spectrum between "R strategy" and "K strategy" along which all animals lie, except that with humans there is a strong cultural component in this choice (or at least Becker et. al. claim or assume that family size has always been a cultural choice for humans -- see my comments on this below).According to this family investment theory, until quite recently (perhaps until the industrial revolution) having more children was the better bet due to lack of reward for skill, and overall underdevelopment of the economy limited the reward for skill, so the world was caught in a Malthusian trap of unskilled labor. However at this recent point in history rewards for skilled labor went up, making it worthwhile for parents to invest in skills (e.g. literacy). Clark's data contradicts this theory: his data show that the ratio of wages for skilled to unskilled laborers did not rise either in the 17th century revolution or during the industrial revolution, and actually were in substantial decline by 1900. Indeed, a decline in demand for skilled labor is what Adam Smith predicted would happen with increasing specialization in manufacturing. Thus, there was no increase in reward for skill investment which would have pulled us out of the Malthusian trap. Thus, Clark also rejects the family investment theory.I think, however, that part of the family investment theory can be rescued. Clark's and other data on literacy demonstrate a substantial rise in literacy just prior to and at the initial stages of the qualitative change in productivity. Literacy in England doubled between 1580 and 1660. Parents were in fact making substantial investments in literacy despite an apparent lack of incentive to do so. Why?My own tentative theory to explains Clark's data combines Becker, Weber, and the observations of many scholars about the cultural importance of printing. Printing was invented in the middle of the 15th century. Books were cheap by the end of that century. Thereafer they just got cheaper. At first books printed en masse what scribes had long considered to be the classics. Eventually, however, books came to contain a wide variety of useful information important to various trades. For example, legal cases became much more thoroughly recorded and far more easily accessible, facilitating development of the common law. Similar revolutions occurred in medicine and a wide variety of trades, and undoubtedly eventually occurred in the building trades that were the source of Clark's data.Printing played a crucial role in the Reformation which saw the schisms from the Roman Church and the birth in particular of Calvinism. The crucial thing to observe is that, while per Clark the gains from investment in skills did not increase relative to unskilled labor, with the availability of cheap books and with the proper content the costs of investing in the learning did radically decrease for many skills. Apprenticeships that used to take seven years could be compressed into a few years reading from books (much cheaper than bothering the master for those years) combined with a short period learning on the job. This wouldn't have been a straightforward process as it required not just cheap books with specialized content about the trades, but some redesigning of the work itself and up-front investment by parents in their children's literacy. Thus, it would have required major cultural changes. That is why, while under my theory cheap books were the catalyst that drove mankind out of the Malthusian trap, many institutional innovations, which took over a century to evolve, had to be made to take advantage of those books to fundamentally change the economy.Probably the biggest change required is that literacy entails a very large up-front investment. In the 17th century that investment would have been undertaken primarily by the family. Such an investment requires delayed gratification -- the trait Weber considered crucial to the rise of capitalism and derived from Calvinsim. However, Calvinist delayed gratification under my revised theory didn't cause capitalism via an increased savings rate, as Weber et. al. postulated, but rather caused parents to undertake a costly practice of investing in their children's literacy. Once that investment was made, the children could take advantage of books to learn skills with unprecedented ease and to skill levels not previously possible. So the overall investment in skills did not increase, but instead the focus of that investment shifted from long apprenticeships of young adults to the literacy of children. At the same time, the productivity of that investment greatly increased, and the result was overall higher productivity.Investment in literacy would have both enabled and been motivated by the famous Protestant belief that people should read the Bible for themselves rather than depending on a priest to read it for them. This process would have started in the late 15th century among an elite of merchants and nobles, giving rise to the Reformation, but might not have propagated amongst the tradesmen Clark tracks until the 17th century. It is with the spread of Huguenot, Puritan, Presbyterian, etc. literacy culture to tradesmen that we see the 17th century revolution in real wages and the first major move away from the Malthusian curve.This theory that the Malthusian trap was evaded by a sharp increase in the productivity of skill investment explains why population growth did not fall in the 17th century as Becker et. al. would predict. Cheap books substantially lowered the cost of skill investment, so the productivity gains could come without increasing the overall investment in skills and thus without lowering family size.The family size/skill investment tradeoff is more likely to explain the second and sharper departure from Malthusian curve starting around 1800. However again I think Becker is wrong insofar as this was not due to an increase in returns on skill (Clark's data debunks this), but due to (1) technology improving faster than humans can have children, and (2) the rise of birth control (without which there is little control by choice or culture over family size -- no cultural family size choice theory really works before the widespread use of birth control).The catalyst in moving away from the Malthusian curve was thus not, per Becker et. al., an increase in the returns on investments in skills, but rather a decrease in the costs of such investments once cheap books teaching specialized trades were available and the initial hill of literacy was climbed by Calvinist families. If the Calvinist literacy-investment theory ("The Roundhead Revolution") is true, we should see a similar departure from the Malthusian curve at the same time or perhaps even somewhat earlier in the Netherlands, and also in Scotland, but probably not in Catholic countries of that period.
The United States Supreme Court in eBay v. MercExchange has held that, instead of applying a general rule that patent infringement leads to an injunction barring the infringer from using the patent, courts instead should, as in most other areas of law, apply the four-factor equity test used for deciding whether to order permanent injunctions. In other words, the plaintiff must show that:(1) it has suffered irreparable injury from the infringement,(2) monetary damages are inadequate to compensate for the injury,(3) the balance of the hardships warrants a remedy in equity (roughly speaking, that the plaintiff will be hurt more by lack of injuntion than the defendant will by the injunction), and(4) the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.This holding overturns that of the U.S. Federal Circuit favoring the general rule that, subject to a few exceptions, injunctions should issue when there is infringement. The Federal Circuit generally hears all appeals in U.S. patent infringement cases. It has been a de facto supreme court of patents, since, at least until this year, the actual Supreme Court accepted patent appeals quite infrequently. If past history is any indication, the Federal Circuit will probably try to liberally interpret the Supreme Court's opinion to maintain the rules that it has championed. Here, it may try to read its rule of general injunctions into the four-factor test.There are a number of clever arguments the Federal Circuit might accept in order to effectively revert to the general rule. It might favor the plaintiff with presumptions that each of the four factors are generally found in patent cases, or reason by analogy that where injunctions were issued in a similar case in the past, the four factors impliedly must have been found, and thus should also be found in the present case. This would allow the Federal Circuit to distinguish eBay as involving a particularly problematic variety of patents (business methods), or even just a particularly problematic instance such patents, and in effect keep applying the general rule to other kinds of patents.Thus, given the structure of U.S. federal courts, where generally all patent appeals go through the Federal Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court may have to take several more injunction cases involving different circumstances than eBay before it effectively overturns the ubiquitous use or threat of injunctions in U.S. patent cases.The concurring opinions also suggest that Justices Thomas and Alito may be the swing votes in the Court's upcoming decision in Metabolite. Chief Justice Roberts will recuse himself. Stay tuned.
While I'm on the subject of applying software metaphors to legal code, here is a short article I recently wrote on the principle of least authority.I go into issues of executive versus legislative power in the U.S. in more depth in Origins of the Non-Delegation Doctrine, with extensive commentary on this subject from both Federalists and Anti-Federalists. (As you may recall, the Federalists were the primary movers behind the original Constitution, and the anti-Federalists were the primary movers behind the Bill of Rights. The Constitution was ratified by most states conditional to a Bill of Rights, which was later pushed through Congress by anti-Federalists and compromising Federalists such as James Madison).The paper also discusses further how protection of liberties was the prime motivation for the mechanisms such as checks and balances in the Constitution. As Locke said:"[w]e agree to surrender some of our natural rights so that government can function to preserve the remainder. Absolute arbitrary power, or governing without settled standing laws, can neither of them consist with the ends of society and government, which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for, nor tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their lives, liberties, and fortunes; and by stated rules of right and property to secure their peace and quiet."[1][1] John Locke, The Second Treatise On Government XI:137 (1691).
Trying to beat the protocol can get you in trouble:
A large variety of rights of travel, especially the rights to travel between states and to leave the United States itself, are incorporated into the United States Constitution via the Ninth Amendment and substantive liberty under the Due Process Clause.   (Take your pick: the Constitution is quite redundant when it comes to asserting unenumerated rights -- we have, alas, repeatedly found it necessary in our history to remind judges that unenumerated rights are the most crucial part of our laws).Travel rights are found as early as the Magna Carta:  It shall be lawful to any person, for the future, to go out of our kingdom, and to return, safely and securely, by land or by water, saving his allegiance to us, unless it be in time of war, for some short space, for the common good of the kingdom: excepting prisoners and outlaws, according to the laws of the land, and of the people of the nation at war against us, and Merchants who shall be treated as it is said above. The Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, expressly protected the right to "free ingress and regress to and from any other State."   These rights of travel, as with a large variety of other traditional rights, were incorporated into the Constitution via the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause and the Ninth Amendment Unenumerated Rights Clause.   Rights of travel were recognized in the 1999 case Saenz v. Roe.During the struggle for freedom in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and their puppet communist governments turned their states into vast prisons by restricting freedom to leave their countries.  The Berlin Wall was a highly visible but small part of this effort.   Many died in their efforts to defect to the free West.  Thus reisen freiheit (freedom of travel) became a key demand of those seeking freedom from these prison states, and when freedom of travel became possible these states fell.   Restrictions and burdens on the right to leave a country are key symptoms that said country is no longer free.
Carter lectures the U.S. on energy, 1978In 1798. the Reverend Thomas Malthus wrote his influential essay on population, arguing that population grows exponentially while the supply of food, energy, and other commodities only grows linearly.  As a result, the vast majority of humankind is doomed to be mired in poverty unless some even grimmer reapers than starvation (war, disease, etc.) are brought to bear, or births are moderated.  In 1978 U.S. president Jimmy Carter, reflecting a popular intellectual Malthusian sentiment of the time, sat by his fireplace in a comfy sweater and instructed Americans to turn down the thermostat lest we run out of oil.  (Here's a similar speech he gave a year earlier).Malthus' description of a general pattern of human history (and indeed of the history of all living things, an observation that inspired Charles Darwin) was by and large accurate.  But since the time of Malthus, writing during the early industrial revolution, developed and even most developing economies have managed to trot or even race ahead of Malthus: per capita income has increased tremendously far beyond the near-starvation limits set by Malthusian theory.  Industrial productivity has pulled vastly increased amounts of commodities from the earth, using them to produce an unprecedented abundance of goods. Meanwhile population growth has radically declined until today many developing economies have below-replacement birthrates. Nevertheless, Malthus' observations and reasoning periodically stage an intellectual and popular comeback: industrial civilization can only cheat Malthus so long, thought leaders warn us; if we do not mend our unsustainable ways, and convert from gluttony to stringent conservation, Malthus' grim formula will soon return to wreak an awful revenge.What chemical inputs does life depend on most?  Hydrogen and oxygen from water is plentiful. Plants obtain copious carbon by breathing in carbon dioxide (and animals from eating the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the plants or other animals). Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (and legume plants that are symbiotic with them) obtain plenty of single-N nitrogen by splitting the plentiful but strongly bonded N2 in our atmosphere.  Artificial means of nitrogen fixing depend primarily on natural gas or oil prices. Metals are plentiful in soil. The only significant remaining scarce ingredients for crops are potassium (K) and phosphorous (P) -- and of these on land phosphorous, which must be available in the form of phosphate, is the most needed and most lacking of all.  No technology can substitute anything else for phosphate: it has to be phosphate in order to form DNA, the essential cell energy molecule ATP, and crucial parts of our bones and teeth. Phosphate is thus the most geopolitically important agricultural input and exhibit A in Malthusian warnings about limited resources and unsustainable practices.  This also makes phosphorous a favorite target of stockpilers and speculators during a Malthusian scare.The most important commodity for mining, manufacturing, and especially transportation, for almost all the 20th century and through the present time, is petroleum oil. Internal combustion and other engines powered by fuels refined from petroleum have since the early decades of the 20th century increasingly dominated he transport of goods and people on air, sea, and land.  For much of the late 19th and 20th centuries heating was a major use of oil; in that use it is being eclipsed by its cousin carbon fuel, natural gas. Oil is also the world's most important feedstock for the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, and a wide variety of other chemicals. While oil makes up a much larger price value of trade than phosphates, oil in the long run is potentially far more vulnerable to substitution innovation. And as we shall see, it also has been at least somewhat more amenable to technological improvements in supply.Between the mid-1800s, by which time the industrial revolution had transformed much of Europe, and the end of the Bretton Woods era, sentiments about the unsustainability of industrial civilization were usually on the intellectual fringe.  But since the late 1960s, cries of doom and sophisticated warnings that we must redesign our economy, our technology, and civilization itself to "sustainable" lifestyles have become mainstream.  Malthusian allegations that we face diminishing, or soon-to-be diminishing, supplies of raw materials such as oil, natural gas, metal ores and fertilizers,  have become "common knowledge." This component of green ideology has been fueled by two Malthusian scares: two substantial periods, the first between about 1968-1980, the second c. 2004-14, during which nominal commodity prices (i.e. the prices you see posted) increased dramatically,  and "real" (adjusted for some measure of inflation, such as the consumer price index) commodity prices increased substantially.  These price rises led to prophecies of a coming great diminution in our abilities to feed, cloth, and transport ourselves, much less to enjoy all the other abundant goods we have become accustomed to in the developed world as a result of the industrial revolutions that have occurred during and since the time of Malthus.  We faced a miserable future unless we changed our ways.  Unless we stopped having babies and stringently conserved and recycle our resources (the general green movement), or invest in solar power and electric cars (the Silicon Valley green movement), our future was deemed to be doom.  This remains a predominant ideology in Western culture today.A big part of those scares and of the green movement has been environmental limits -- that we are damaging our environments, our planet, the one and only planet we can ever hope to naturally inhabit in the foreseeable future, far too much -- adding too much sulfur dioxide, ozone, or carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, too many fertilizers to our waterways, etc.  This essay does not address those concerns, which provide a far stronger argument for the sustainability movement than the topic of this essay -- the supply of commodities, especially of raw minerals from the earth such as oil, metal ores, and fertilizers, and the theories that have become popular since the late 1960s that historical rates of industrial growth cannot be sustained in the face of expected future diminution of those supplies.  Indeed, if you are already scared by our ability to pollute our planet, after you finish reading this essay you should be even more scared. Our planet places no material limits on our ability to consume and pollute it. If we are to have such limits we must put them in place, politically, ourselves.  (As for me, I'm scared both by the prospects for greater pollution and by the fact that political solutions and hoped-for advances in technology, not natural limits, will be the only ways to address the threats of pollution. The greatest source of domestic disputes is fighting over the thermostat; I expect this trend will carry over to international climate disputes of the future...)For many of us in the developed world, a future of higher prices for energy and other commodities does not seem like such big a deal as it once did: we already have more physical goods than we know what to do with, and cutting back to achieve more peace of mind now seems to take and be worth more effort than accumulation. While the better-off fractions of the developed world have by and large reached a level of satisfaction in their consumption of the abundance of goods made possible by the industrial revolutions, the poorer fractions and the developing world have not. Nevertheless, during the Malthusian scares commodities did seem to grow much more expensive and scarcer -- and not just a few commodities but commodities in general.  Indeed, the prices of a broad range of industrial commodities went substantially higher, often much faster than the general inflation rate  -- a sure sign, according to traditional industrial economics, that industrial supply was being outstripped by consumer demand -- that we were getting approaching, often rapidly, Malthusian limits rather than moving further away from them as has been the general trend since Malthus.  During most of the years of the first and second scares raw material and food prices skyrocketed, practically across the board. Why was this happening, if not the predictions of Malthusians starting to come true?  Let's take a look at the scares, and the economic histories surrounding them, to find out.  Prelude to the First Malthusian ScareFrom ancient civilization to the late 1960s, civilization's money was generally defined by, and either consisted of or was convertible to, standard weights of precious metals. Even thousands of years before the invention of coinage, most fines in the earliest recorded code of laws were defined and paid in weights of silver.  While the role of precious metals in monetary affairs declined throughout the 20th century, with many episodes of fiat currencies untied to precious metals inflating and hyperinflating, under the post-World War II Bretton Woods system United States and its allies up to 1968 had a gold window whereby authorized high rollers (among them most other governments) could still cash in their dollars for gold at a promised official rate.  Under Bretton Woods most other free world currencies were pegged to the dollar.  So you could cash in your local currency for dollars, and (if you were an authorized high roller) your dollars for gold, all at committed official prices.But Bretton Woods, depending on a single country to ultimately back the entire free world's money, was not financially sustainable.  It established the U.S. dollar as the free-world standard after World War II, when the the U.S. made half the world's industrial goods and held over half of its financial reserves. But the economies damaged by World War II quickly recovered, and agricultural and industrial revolutions spread to the developing world where economic growth greatly quickened.  While the U.S. economy in its own terms was thriving,  the relative U.S. role in the world economy declined as those of the rest of the world quickly rose from the ashes. By the mid-1960s the U.S. held only 16% of the world's financial reserves, and even less than that of its gold reserves.  Even though it promised to exchange dollars for gold on demand, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued more notes, and its banks more broadly issued more dollar credit, than could possibly be securely backed by its diminishing gold reserves.Meanwhile, most academic and government economists scoffed at the gold standard as a "barbarous relic" and held that world monetary conditions would be improved if the U.S. stopped pretending that the dollar was pegged to gold.  By 1968 the U.S. was no longer willing to honor its commitment to deliver an ounce of gold for $35.  The U.S., which since the time of Franklin Roosevelt had banned the domestic private gold trade, now tried with futility to halt overseas private trade by refusing to deal in gold with governments that allowed private gold trade.  (In reality, this was less a serious attempt to stifle overseas private gold trade than an attempt to close down the gold window in a face-saving way).  The U.S. government forced the London Gold Pool, the gold window mechanism operating between the major free world central banks, to declare a "bank holiday", i.e. shut down its operations.  But of course this didn't stop non-Americans from trading in gold; quite the opposite: it signaled that the U.S. dollar, and all the currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, had radically changed in form, and might no longer be as reliable as a store of value. The free-market price of gold soon rose well above $35 official rate. The U.S. was by 1971 forced to officially float the dollar (it had already been floating de facto for up to three years), officially making the U.S. dollar a purely fiat currency.  The pegged currencies followed suit, and Bretton Woods was dead.All this monetary obscurity matters for our Malthusian scares not just because all the aforesaid commodity prices from then until now are quoted in major fiat currencies, most usually in dollars, and these signals prices send about industrial supply and demand can only be as reliable as the currencies those prices are denominated in. Such a consideration could, with good statistics based on good records, be reasonably dealt with by computing the "real", inflation-adjusted prices of commodities.  But commodity prices proceeded to skyrocket even in general-inflation-adjusted terms The dawn of the pure fiat, floating currency regime caused far deeper forces to come into play.For in reality, post-gold-standard prices for industrial commodities are not driven purely, or often even mostly, by industrial demand being met by appropriate changes in material supply.  Instead, both supply and demand curves have been warped by a new role for the major industrial commodities -- they are no longer purely commodities; the are in part also money.  In particular, they have since the late 1960s been increasingly used as a liquid store of value, easily tradeable for media of exchange (e.g. dollars), as an alternative to and hedge for the new regime of floating rate currencies. Noise in the signal: radical increase in volatility of two of the most important geopolitical minerals, crude oil and phosphate, between the Bretton Woods  (1947-70) and floating rate (1970-present) eras.What does it mean to say a commodity is part money?  For this we need to turn to economist Carl Menger's theory of the origins of money.  Menger's theory is less an accurate account of how money did historically originate among humans (which happened long before the dawn of the efficient commodity markets postulated by Menger), as a good theory and reasonably accurate set of predictions about how a free barter market economy does behave whenever it does arise.  According to Menger, in a world of market-based barter, a very high cost (which economists would now call a transaction cost) comes from having to keep track of on the order of N^2 prices for the N goods, and the lack of coincidence of mutual wants between the holders of any two particular such commodities.For this reason market participants start spontaneously treating some goods as intermediate commodities.  Intermediate commodities are held, not to consume them, but to store value until the next opportunity for exchange comes along.  The intermediate commodity's price increases substantially from what it was when it was just demanded for its consumption: it obtains a price premium for its use as a store of value immune from the changing values of currency or currency-denominated assets the holder of the intermediate commodity would have otherwise held.  This price premium waxes and wanes with the weighted changes in inflation expectations of the world's main traded currencies.Many commodities might be used this way: and every commodity that is used in this way becomes, in part, money.  It is no longer just an good whose supply is driven by purely by the costs of production (since producers may choose to withhold production rather than sell for a currency whose inflation expectations have just increased, or may choose to increase production beyond the needs of immediate demand when inflation expectations have decreased), or whose demand is driven purely by desires or needs for its consumption (since some of the demand -- the vast majority of the demand in the case of gold and silver -- is now for its use as a store of value). It is an intermediate commodity, partial money.When the primary use of the commodity money is as a medium of exchange, for example the cigarettes used as money in some wartime prisons, strong network effects usually exist to cause the market to converge on one or a few standards -- historically, usually gold and silver.  These undergo a "bubble that does not pop". But the other intermediate commodities, the commodities don't make it all the way to being dominant and nearly pure money, are bubbles that can and do pop.When the primary use of commodity money is, however, a store of value, a store of value that can be readily exchanged when needed for the actual medium of exchange, there is almost no network effect.  Any commodity that can be stored and so traded can be used as store of value that will render the owner immune from the perceived or actual risks of holding a floating currency. This storage could occur in the form of a paper or digital future, or as the actual commodity in the warehouse, or even as a readily extractable mineral such as oil still in the ground.Since the end of Bretton Woods, the major industrial commodities, and especially the major geopolitical commodities such as oil and phosphates, have become Mengerian.  They are no longer purely industrial commodities.  They are also stores of value, places to put wealth in between obtaining money and spending it, that provide an alternative for those who wish to diversify away from, for various reasons, holding currency or assets such as bonds and derivatives that are defined by or correlated to the health of currencies.  In the face of increasing inflation expectations, stockpiling of commodities also decreases the risk that further economic growth that nations may be expecting or planning for in their economies could only come at the costs of even purchasing the needed inputs at even higher prices in the future (e.g. China in the 2000s). Stockpiling of commodities is also a general strategy whenever international trust erode and leaders start thinking of potential risks that trade will be slowed or embargoed.There are other securities that can store and even grow value -- stocks, bonds, real estate.  In many ways all these are better stores of value than commodities.  However for a major financial and political power, they have drawbacks.  First, they are trust-based -- you are trusting somebody (often a foreigner) to pay the coupons or dividends.  In the case of real estate, it depends on the vagaries of local economic activity and politics. Commodities, especially commodities a government can physically control, are far more trust-minimized.  The U.S. can sanction Russia by freezing the assets of its national held in paper or digital form in the U.S., but it cannot take the oil from Russia's wells or stop it from drilling, pumping, and selling it to e.g. Europe.  Finally, commodities in most of their forms, especially as futures, are readily exchanged for pure money such as dollars. Since the theme of this paper is Malthusian resources, we shall focus on the waxing and waning of the intermediateness of commodities, and in particular the geolitical commodities oil and phosphate rock.Thus industrial commodities, and especially minerals important to geopolitics like crude oil and phosphate, serve at least three major purposes in the post Bretton Woods world beyond just industrial or agricultural consumption:(a) a hedge against increases in expected inflation in floating rate currencies, or greater uncertainties about same,(b) for governments, protection against coercive economic sanctions by foreign governments, and(c) for militarily strong countries, a form of wealth relatively immune from foreign attack in time of warWe will see all these factors at play during the first and second Malthusian scares.The First Malthusian ScareOil "chasing the tail of gold" during the 1970s. (Source)As described above, the Bretton Woods era ended between 1968 and 1971, leading to the purely floating rate regime that has prevailed from 1971 to today. Free trade in gold, which had been banned under Franklin Roosevelt, was returned to the U.S.Shortly thereafter, in 1973-4, an event that many economists have deemed an "exogenous shock", and even a main cause of the dramatic oil price rises of the 1970s, occurred on the world stage: the Arab oil embargo of Britain and the U.S. in response to their intervention on behalf of Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  Around the same time OPEC more than doubled the dollar prices it charged for its oil.  It is common but highly inaccurate to call OPEC a "monopoly cartel" at that time -- it accounted for only about 3% of U.S. oil consumption in 1967 and still only 6.7% at the end of 1973.  It had increased its pricing power from negligible to slight; it could hardly have more than doubled the price of oil on its own had not other oil-producing companies and countries been of similar mind.One dog didn't bark: oil prices around the times of the Suez crisis (1956-7), in which Europe lost control of over half its oil supply, and the Arab Crisis (73-74), involving a temporary embargo that was easy to get around by trading through cutout countries.By sharp contrast, the Suez Crisis of 1956-7, which produced a much more dramatic and longer-lasting impact on the world's oil supply chains -- Europe suddenly lost military control over more than half of the oil it consumed to a recently independent and hostile Egypt, never to gain it back -- was followed by a far smaller and more ephemeral percentage increase in oil prices.Due to the increased inflation expectations, oil producers conserved on pumping, despite rising prices and oil consumers stockpiled despite the rising prices of funding those purchases. The reverse would happen throughout the decreases in inflation expectations and resulting long decline in commodity prices during most of the 1980s and 1990s.  Oil producers kept pumping beyond the needs of the industrial market to hasten the drawdown of their depreciating reservoirs.What the voter saw: U.S. consumer price index 1973-81.But during the first Malthusian scare, U.S. and European entities began stockpiling oil and other strategic commodities. For example U.S. oil imports from the Middle East, which had been only about 3% of consumption in 1967 when relations were friendly, had increased to 6.7% by 1973 even though relations had become hostile. and nominal prices of that oil had risen. Meanwhile U.S. oil producers were pumping less oil, choosing to keep relatively more of it in the ground rather than sell it for cheapening dollars.The Second Malthusian Scare As in the 1970s, thecommodity rise during the second Malthusian scare of roughly 2004-14 was often sharp and concurrently effected the vast majority of commodities. After substantial advances in both real estate and commodityprices the previous several years, during 2007 central banks cut rates andraise money supplies to fight collapsing real estate prices. These effortsfueled sharp increases in inflation expectations. Nominal and CPI-adjusted pricesof fossil fuels, precious metals, industrial metals, lumber, fibers,fertilizers, grains, oilseeds, dairy, and livestock all skyrocketed during2007, hitting record highs in nominal prices.  The market’s endless search for stores ofvalue independent of the vagaries of fiat currencies had switched from real estate on which easy loans were defaulting tocommodities that could be held more securely.  This time the most (in)famous stockpiler was China, planning for the rapid economic growth it expected in the decades ahead.Also as in the 1970s, the individual componentsof this broad-range trend were attributed to a stupendous variety ofidiosyncratic causes -- the co-occurrence of which all driving prices in thesame direction at the same time was astronomically improbable. The only reasonable attribution would be to related common causes – which, given that therehad been no sudden worldwide industrial boom, had to have been monetary causes.Warnings about peak oil, peak phosphorous, etc. issued from all the major media outlets and science journals.  In Silicon Valley, a boom in "green technology" startups and investments ensued -- resulting later in mostly bankrupt companies.  As I wrote at the time:It is a gross violation of Occam's Razor to attribute the recent very broad-based run-up in dollar commodity prices primarily to the plethora of disparate causes to which they have been attributed: "peak oil", the war in Iraq, ethanol subsidies displacing food, and so on. Rises in industrial demand, increases in the costs of transporting commodities due to high oil prices, and so on explain only a small fraction of the rise in other commodity prices, and do not explain at all why precious metal prices have increased alongside those of other commodities. Occam's Razor points us, as it did to wise investors and economists in the 1970s, to the one kind of commodity all these other commodities have in common: the currencies they are priced in......demand for the oft-dreaded but ill-understood "hoarding" and "speculation", that is storing extra commodities (often off-the-books, or at least not in the officially measured warehouses) and the purchase of extra commodity futures and other commodity derivatives to hedge transactions based on government currencies, will remain strong as long as the Federal Reserve continues to inflate the dollar supply, and as long as many developing countries continue to link their currencies to this dollar. Commodity prices in dollars will level off, and then move back down close to historical trends based largely on just industrial consumption, if or when the Fed stops increasing the supply of dollars faster than the demand for dollars. As it transpired, neither the Malthusian worries nor, as of this writing, the inflation expectations proved justified.  The run-up in oil helped fund the fracking revolution, a technology which defied peak oil theory:Theory: peak oil diagram after Hubbert.  Alleged to apply at all scales not just to individual wells.Reality: not as simple as theoryOil thus demonstrated itself as a poorer monetary substitute than gold: being a much more novel commodity than gold, its production is subject to substantially more likelihood of technological invention and geological discovery.    Fracking in one diagramThis possibility, which had not been sufficiently priced into oil before fracking, makes oil supply less reliably scarce than that of gold, rendering it less useful as a store of value, reducing the monetary premium of the oil price over oil as it would be priced if it were just an industrial commodity. Secondly, of course, is the direct effect of fracking on the supply curve in lowering oil prices.  The effects of the fracking revolution are amplified because more than just the Econ-101 supply curve shift is reducing oil prices due to fracking: oil's monetary premium is being eroded at the same time. Oil had been a monetary bubble which is now bursting.If you are Saudi Arabia or Iraq sitting on large reservoirs of easily extracted oi, your alternative to treating oil as a store of value, if you still don't trust the Western powers, is to pump even more and trade the proceeds for gold (and also pay off some foolishly acquired debts) -- which is what we now see happening. Thus, paradoxically (to those who analyze oil as no more than an industrial commodity) oil producing countries pump more oil despite much lower oil prices. They are selling oil from their "oil warehouse" below the sands of the Middle East in exchange for gold, which due to the fracking revolution has reasserted its superiority as a trust-minimized currency over oil. If "money is the bubble that doesn't pop", partial money, i.e. Mengerian intermediate commodities, create bubbles that sometimes do pop, as the desirability of various commodities for their monetary properties, especially their value as a store of value relatively immune from political interdiction, waxes and wanes.As much good news as bad: the two Malthusian scares sandwich an era when inflation-commodity prices fell by about the same amount that they rose during the two scares combined. (And they have fallen further since 2010). The explanation of "tight money" vs. "easy money" is pertinent but oversimplified, as one would expect an attempt to explain a theory in chart labels to be...ConclusionDuring the Bretton Woods era the U.S. dollar, pegged to gold at $35 an ounce, served the entire free world as a common and reliable standard of value.  The transition from Bretton Woods to floating rates left the world with no common and reliable standard of value by which to guarantee future real returns on contracts or investments.  As a result the most commonly traded commodities, and especially geopolitical commodities such as oil and phosphates, became Mengerian intermediate commodities, with a price premium as a store of value that waxed and waned with the weighted expected inflation among the world's various floating currencies. As a result, the prices of these commodities are much more volatile since 1970 than they were during the Bretton Woods era. Epochs of increasing inflation expectations have led to rapid, broad-based commodity price rises, where the market gives out false signals of scarcity, leading to Malthusian anxieties and panics that we face a future of diminishing natural resources. This in turn has fueled a major and sustainable growth in green ideology since the 1960s.It's no longer debatable that commodity supplies in general pose few limits to long-term industrial growth, nor, except in the special case of phosphates, any significant limits that cannot eventually be innovated past by substituting newer more abundant materials for scarcer older ones.  To obtain all the commodities we have consumed in history has involved barely scratching he surface of one planet. Scratching out somewhat more each upcoming decade and century into the foreseeable future is, in terms of that supply, by and large sustainable. A far more debatable proposition is to how much environmental impacts will or should limit industrial growth -- for example, what is or should be our ability to continue pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? That is a debate this paper shall leave for another day.
I spent several years working as an information security engineer.  I've written on the mathematics of information quite a bit, including my Introduction to Algorithmic Information Theory,   The Abuse of Statistics in Cryptography, and Absolute Compression and True Randomness.
Recently I've been both daydreaming and pondering some of the problems that daydreaming can cause.I've recently learned that not only do interstellar meteors rudely hit our lovely planet, but some of them may be quite valuable, e.g. black diamond, which leading researchers believe to be the products of supernovae.   The Amsterdam diamond sold in 2001 for about $52,000 per gram. The fact that multiple black diamonds have been found on earth suggests that there may be many tonnes of such diamonds flying through the solar system at any given time.  By naive extrapolation one tonne of black diamond should be worth $52 billion, but common sense suggests otherwise.  If somebody launched a robot to grab a tonne of black diamond out of the darkness of deep space and fling it into the sea, then cut and polished it up for auction, the resulting gem(s) would almost surely fetch only a tiny fraction of that $52 billion.  This presents the interesting puzzle: what happens when a collectible, the value of which depends on its stable scarcity, (and thus, its shape of its demand curve depends in part on the shape of its supply curve), suddenly is discovered to be common?  Its price might fall far faster than would be expected for a normal commodity demanded solely for its consumption.  This suggests, too, that the recent rise in the use of commodities for their monetary properties may in some cases be quite fragile.  Where new cheap sources or substitutions are discovered for a commodity, the price of that commodity might fall much farther and faster than if consumption alone shaped the demand curve.  This may be a good argument for the gold bugs, if such a breakthrough is less likely for precious metals like gold than for other commodities.  I find it a good argument for diversification across a basket or index of commodities.  Either of these strategies is still vulnerable to a a return to good fiat currency policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank.Speaking of daydreaming about space, Mike Thomas well describes the utter waste NASA has made, and is still trying to make, out of our tax money and our daydreams.   That NASA has talked many space fans into believing that government can successfuly plan for and design infrastructure for hypothetical future business exceeds in idiocy even the old state socialism, which showed time and again (with over a hundred million starved) that central agencies couldn't plan satisfactorily for even present industrial needs. And now for a nice exercise in pure daydreaming: SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.  The Drake Equation makes it all sound very scientific, but plausible inputs into the Drake Equation can make its ouptut vary by nearly twenty orders of magnitude.  At one extreme there may be no civilizations in the visible universe except us.  At the other extreme many SETI people believe that each galaxy may be full of millions of rather compressed and cryptic civilizations.  There are plenty of people who find one extreme quite plausible and the other quite implausible, for each extreme, and plenty of plausible arguments for each side, but in fact we just don't know.  SETI is an obvious example of an error that is far too common, if less obviously so, in many other areas of science: too many people who style themselves as scientists present highly uncertain opinions, based on obscure or questionable assumptions, as if they were accurate facts or settled theories.  The precision and confidence of their language often far exceeds their accuracy.  Modern science is so specialized that even the vast majority of fellow scientists often don't have the time to dig in to unearth the hidden assumptions behind their fellows' claims.  They like us come to accept opinions, possibly of a highly uncertain nature, as facts based on the authority of the scientists.Mistaking precision for accuracy is also one of the big problems with with attempting to predict the future needs of commerce, as NASA has purported to do.   As if exagerated claims to accuracy and the hiding of assumptions weren't bad enough, due to the dominance of one kind of funding, namely government funding, most of the scientists in some fields share common biases, especially political biases to justify expanded government budgets.  Authority increasingly takes the form of political power, funding increasingly requires political power, and political power, rather than facts, has been increasingly the source of "scientific consensus."  Here is more on the the trouble with modern science.
Every year millions of people spend days or weeks on cruises, but Patri Friedman, Wayne Gramlich, and their fellow Seasteaders want to live on the sea full time.  They want, essentially, to conduct political experiments in mobile communities as free as possible from sovereign jurisdictions.  To do this, they are designing extravagant new kinds of structures that they believe will withstand the violent storms and other harsh conditions that can occur offshore.Besides tourism and jurisdictional arbitrage, there are a variety of other economic incentives to live on the ocean.  Fishing and fish processing often involve employees spending many months at sea.  Oil, diamonds, and soon a wide variety of other kinds of minerals are increasingly being extracted as land-based minerals are slowly depleted.Gramlich and Friedman have a very admirable goal but are trying to do too many things in parallel.  They seem to have spent far more time in creating futuristic designs from scratch than in figuring out how to retrofit normal ships or mobile offshore oil platforms.  On top of this is their important but novel and ambitious political experiment in lowering exit costs.  While there are some relationships between the politics and the engineering, a better approach is to innovate in one area at a time.  Design novel offshore technology, or design novel offshore communities, but don't try to do too much of both at once.Friedman voices a complaint, hardly uncommon in the world of engineering, that he has a hard time communicating with ocean engineers.  I suspect the problem is that Friedman and Gramlich have taken their designs, whether workable or not, far away from the kinds of designs ocean engineers are used to analyzing. If they just started with normal ships and offshore platforms, then used such equipment as building blocks for larger structures, rather than trying to reinvent ocean engineering from scratch, they would not lack for experienced engineers to understand their designs and shops to assemble them.Sure, such structures seem crude and inefficient compared with the elegant and optimal structures that might be designed in theory.  But they would be a far less expensive way to demonstrate the political and economic viability of seasteading.  And they could be shown to offshore engineers who could quickly recognize most major problems they might have.  The Friedman/Gramlich approach excites the imagination, but a far more incremental approach is needed to make it work.  To take up Friedman's analogy: if all that exists are military planes, and you want to start the first civilian airline, don't try designing civilian planes and civilian airports from scratch.  Just buy a bomber, yank out the bomb bays and guns, install passenger seats, get permission to use a couple military airports, take a few test flights, and start selling tickets. The first version may well fall very short of the optimal or ideal you have in mind, but it will give you the experience and the revenue needed to improve the design and approach that optimal.The biggest technological hurdle to meeting the requirements of the political experiment is probably the ability to join and separate the floating platforms at low cost.  They must be moored and yet withstand the harshest storms (or alternatively to anticipate the storm, quickly unmoor, ride out the storm separately, and remoor when normalcy returns).   This problem is mentioned briefly here but as far as I know, Seasteaders have not come up with a good solution for it.Mooring in rough water is a hard problem -- there are good reasons docks lie in sheltered bays. Ship-to-ship refueling, a common naval procedure, has long been very dangerous in bad weather.  Ships and platforms loosely moored with cables can easily collide, smashed together by wind and wave, with devastating consequences. Friedman and Gramlich believe that their ideal platform will have "no" bobbing, lateral movement, or tilting from waves and wind. But oil platforms do exhibit enough such movements that trying to keep them moored together with traditional techniques in a storm would be highly dangerous.  Cables could not prevent the platforms from colliding with high force, whereas a completely rigid mooring that coupled the movements of all the joined platforms would likely fail from strain.Some good old Internet searching digs up the fact that folks in the deep sea oil and liquified natural gas (LNG) industries have solved a similar problem -- how to offload fluids offshore, from FPSOs to tankers or from tankers to offshore pipeline terminals.  For example the LNG industry needs to be able to hook up the huge LNG tankers to the offshore offloading terminals even in storms.  One solution to this is the soft yoke flexible mooring.  This is often abbreviated "SYMO" for "soft yoke mooring and offloading".  It allows ships to moor to each other without the dangers of approaching and colliding in rough wind and water.A soft yoke flexible mooring (SYMO) for yoking ships together, even in rough waves and most storms.  The design allows each ship to ride the waves separately, greatly reducing the strain on the yoke, while keeping them from approaching or dispersing.Here's how I might do an experiment in offshore political mobility using off-the-shelf equipment or minor variations on same (this "mixed" version, as the Seasteaders would call it, is not terribly original to me, except for including a workable mooring technology):(1) Get a few dozen yacht owners to participate as volunteers.  ("Yacht" here just refers to any seaworthy boat capable of mooring to other such craft and to larger platforms with SYMOs).(2) Set up a system of two or more privately owned offshore anchored moorings: tough cable moorings such as those used by large ships in the oil industry (eg FPSOs).  (3) Attach a small old cruise ship or retrofitted oil platform to each anchored mooring. These should be large enough to have most of the infrastructure a small cruise ship would have, and be able to provide basic services to the yachts.(4) Yachts moor to the larger ship or platform using SYMOs.  For oil platforms the SYMOs may have to be heavily modified.  Yachts might also moor to each other using SYMOs, but some of the yachts should also be anchor-moored to the ocean floor, unless they don't mind the community drifting.(5) Yacht owners choose which of the two or more communities they will join.(6) The cruise ships or platforms that form the core of these communities compete to provide various services, amenities, and political systems.(7) Yacht owners can either be independently wealthy, or they can make a living by providing services to nearby fishing fleets, fish processors, offshore oil platforms, etc., or by providing temporary quarters for workers of same.(8) When a storm comes that may be too much for the small SYMOs to withstand, everybody gets on yachts and disperses until the storm blows over.These communities would look a bit like this offshore floating dock in a sheltered bay near Lund, British Columbia -- but much farther offshore, larger, more robust, and more politically independent.If you see this coming, scram.There will be big differences between these salty communities and modern towns.  If the local court or zoning board or captain-of-captains won't approve improvements to your yacht, or your desire to set up a gambling house or a stinky fish processing plant, just move your house to another seastead community that will tolerate it.  (I suspect fish processors will retain their own separate communities).  Low exit costs bring freedom. One kind of public nuisance that these seasteads may be in special danger of running into is what I call a provocative externality, meaning that besides or instead of being ethically dubious or causing direct harm to the community, they may cause danger to fellow community members by provoking a country to attack the seastead: drug smuggling, money laundering, polygamy, being a haven for terrorists, and so on are examples of activities that could, whether rightly or wrongly, provoke attack.  Since many of these activities might also be quite lucrative, the political issues of whether to ban them may cause great tensions.  Vulnerability to attack by traditional countries limits the degree of substantive liberty seasteads can achieve -- they will not be able to achieve a perfectly voluntary society within even the substantive law, much less within procedural law, which I now turn to.The political and legal designs for Seasteads need even more work than the engineering designs.  It is not enough to just say that all law be based on contract and thus all will be fine.  One must rather tackle crucial issues such as legal procedure.  As I have written elsewhere, in response to a claim that Seastead government will not be based on coercion:No coercion? In these Seasteads, who does the law enforcement, and who or what gives them the right to commit law enforcement acts that are physically equivalent to torts and crimes? What distinguishes arrest from assault and battery, imprisonment from kidnapping, legal distraint of goods from theft, or a legal search from trespass? I think you will find that these societies will have to deal with the very same problems of coercion and procedure as our own governments. Calling a legal document that defines and allocates rights to commit these coercive acts a "contract" instead of a "constitution" may be the Rothbard-correct way to do things, but it doesn't actually go very far towards solving the hard problems of living together in a world where people are often coercive.It is even more important for the political and legal designs than it is for the engineering designs to take an off-the-shelf approach.  Pick a country and subdivisions thereof, either a current or a well-document historical politican and legal system (for example the U.S. and a particular state, county, and town), and use its constitution, statutes, and court precedents as basic legal precedents, which can then be modified by local courts (in a common-law manner) and other local political authorities.  If the U.S. is used as a model, I have suggested some basic changes to make its constitution less subject to the growth of government power. Low exit costs will also greatly help.  These kinds of macro-political issues will mostly, however, be well beyond the scope of Seasteading unless or until they reach a time when they are large and mature mobile cities.   The first ones will, as with cruise ships today, probably just be based on the "captain is king" model that has long dominated sea law.  Friedman has even taken to calling himself "Captain Patri".  Perhaps seasteads will revive the old paradigm of political property rights.  I wish these projects the best of luck.
In modern commodity markets one can exchange money for commodities at almost zero transaction costs. These markets thus reflect not just the supply and demand of the commodity, but also the supply and demand of the currency they are priced in.Because they combine liquidity with short- and medium-term supply inelasticity, mineral commodities are a good way to hedge a falling currency. When the supply of money increases or is expected to increase, whether because of lower nominal or real interest rates, because the bank that issues the currency is buying government treasury bonds or (like John Law of Mississippi Bubble infamy) mortgage-backed securities[*], or for any other reason, a disproportionate amount of the expected or surprise increase in money supply is soaked up by commodities.  Indeed the commodities with the most liquid markets and inelastic supply, such as oil and gold, tend to move in lock-step with each other. Such price movement is strong evidence for the movement being primarily a phenomenon of changing money supply or demand rather than of changing supply or demand for particular commodities. If oil prices were rising primarily due to rising industrial demand for oil, or primarily because oil was getting more expensive technologically to produce (e.g. "peak oil" theory), we'd expect them to move quite differently than gold, which is demanded for primarily non-industrial reasons and has a vastly greater  inventory/production ratio on the supply side than oil.  That's not what we see -- we see oil and gold moving together, and indeed the price of oil in terms of gold and silver has been practically flat in the recent commodity boom.  This is almost entirely due to expected or actual increases in the supplies of the currencies they are traded in (and especially recently in the weak dollar) rather than to "real" factors.This inflation only slowly percolates into price rises in other goods and services, which tend to be far more rigid than commodities. Wages are particularly rigid. Because the U.S. Federal Reserve and most other central banks regulate their money supplies based on trailing indicators of inflation(e.g. consumer price indices) rather than leading indicators (commodity prices), it is no surprise that their decisions tend to produce boom-and-bust cycles in commodities, and that to a lesser and more delayed extent they cause both general inflation and recessions. No uncommon demand from China or the like is needed to explain the recent commodity boom, just as no such rise in demand or long-term fall in supply was needed to explain the very similar commodity boom in the 1970s. But since most people judge supply and demand of a commodity by nominal price, both in the 1970s and now we get a lot of irrational hysteria about "running out", "peak oil", how our energy industries and consumption are "unsustainable", etc. I'll believe that when oil per barrel doubles or more with respect to gold and silver. When they move together, we're just being fooled by monetary instability, and most of the current disproportionate increase in investment in energy supplies and conservation, whether traditional or renewable, is malinvestment in response to highly distorted nominal price signals, as is the accompanying political bubble of "energy security", conservation enforced through idiotic micro-regulations (e.g. banning traditional light bulbs), and so on.Another way of putting this is that, when currencies become unreliable as a store of value, commodities take on part of that monetary role. Both oil and gold increase in value by performing this monetary function better than the currency against which they are being traded, better than credit instruments denominated in that currency, and even better, in the short term, than stocks of companies that do business primarily in that currency.  The joint movements in oil and gold reflect their value, relative to the currency they are priced in, performing the monetary function of a store of value. Global supplies and industrial demands for minerals are far less volatile than the change in their value in this monetary role. It's the logical emergence of money from barter, but this emergence goes on every day that liquid commodities act as a better store of value than the currency in which they are priced. Contrariwise, as the currency becomes a better store of value than the commodity, these commodities move back down towards just being commodities valued only for their consumption. Thus their exaggerated moves, both upward and downward, in reaction to changing expectations of future increases or decreases in money supply. Due to their exaggerated moves and the relative rigidity of most non-commodity prices, commodities themselves are an imperfect store of value. They react far more than the general level of prices to both increases and decreases in money supply, or changing expectations of same. If the Fed stops playing John Law and desists from buying bad mortgages, if others besides the Fed soak up all the new Treasuries produced by large federal budget deficits, ifcounterparty risk in credit markets subsides, the Fed can raise rates, sell securities and retire the money, and otherwise take steps to lower the money supply and stanch inflation. In such a case, commodities will react disproportionately on the downside, as they did in the 1980s.   If the Federal Reserve can't do these things, dollars and dollar-denominated securities will continue to decline and people will increasingly turn to commodities to protect their nest eggs. All the ads I see and hear for gold these days suggests the peak of a commodity bubble is near, but on the other hand credit markets may worsen due to the continued crashing of the previous bubble (the housing/mortgage bubble), federal deficits may continue to increase, and the Fed may thus buy even more securities, making commodities even more attractive. I'm thus afraid that I have no buy or sell recommendations for you, dear readers.  :-)[This comment is based on a comment I recently made at the Marginal Revolution blog].* [Obligatory Wikipedia links: John Law, Mississippi Bubble, BearStearns bailout][UPDATE: reader Byrne Hobarth has linked to this excellent analysis of the commodities market.  This study debunks the theories that trends in supply or consumption demand, very steady over the last century, have greatly changed over the last decade.  In particular, increased demand for many commodities such as copper in China has been offset by slows in growth or declines in demand in Europe and the U.S. The studies' thesis is that the commodity runup is largely just a bubble.  The study shows the spectacular rise in commodity derivatives.  These represent far more contractual liability or asset than the underlying commodities.  Treating commodities as money, this to me looks like a new emergent form of fractional reserve banking, but reconstructed in the investment rather than the banking sector.  These derivatives, on this view, act essentially as private fractional reserve currencies, backed by a variety of commodities.  The report views all this as evidence of a bubble.  It points out we haven't yet seen the consumer inflation of the previous commodity bull.  I emphasize yet.  Consumer prices are a trailing indicator, and I believe the commodity markets are more rational in anticipating and reacting to money supply increases than they were in the 1970s thanks to the dominance of derivatives.  The development of these new kinds of currencies, though prone to the risks and errors of novelty, are largely rational.]
Genovese coat of arms with gryphons and cross of St. George.Genoa was the most commercially innovative city of premodern times. Insurance, the joint-stock corporation, close cooperation between navy and merchant marine, international trade and exploration, and banking all made substantial progress in Genoa. The basic drivers of these innovations were Genoa's merchant culture and its unprecedented commitment to freedom of contract.La Lanterna, the harbor lighthouse. 40 meters of rock and 77 meters of tower put the lantern 117 meters above sea level at the harbor mouth. The current version dates from the 16th century, but a lighthouse tower has been at the location from at least the 12th century.Genoa was probably a significant port under the Greeks, Etruscans, and then the Romans, but is not recorded as playing a major role in history during those periods. It declined in the Dark Ages but revived by the 11th century and was one of the first Italian towns to assert its independence. It played an important role in transporting and protecting crusader fleets and those of the merchants and colonists who followed. During the Crusades it gained footholds on the strategic bottlenecks of the Dardanelles and of the Bosporus across from Constantinople, giving it access to the Black Sea and the Silk Road to China.The Genovese were the chief commercial innovators of the later Middle Ages, and if anything was key to their innovations it was their advanced contract law and their commitment to freedom of contract. Nothing showed this commitment more than its long struggle against Church doctrine banning usury, which at the time meant any charging of interest. Genovese contracts "hid" interest charges as profits (which were acceptable) or in exchange rates.The Galata Tower, built by the Genovese on the Bosporus across from Constantinople during the crusades. Their shared control over the Bosporus opened up the lucrative Oriental trade and allowed them to plant colonies along the Black Sea.An example of the use of exchange rates to incorporate interest was the "dry loan" which structured interest as a transport charge commonly used in a "wet loan" which were normally paid off in a distant city as a way of transmitting money. Church leaders recognized many of these ruses and complained, but since Genovese municipal judges were, like the rest of the Genovese community, staunch advocates of freedom of contract, and since the Church was dependent on Genovese power (for example to transport and protect crusaders and pilgrims on the seas), the judges winked at these ruses and the Church mostly did not crack down on the practice. In the process of developing these ruses the Genovese became creative drafters of commercial contracts and learned to distinguish elements such as risk, loan, and investment that had been bundled together and treated as inseparable in previous eras.Perhaps the chief Genovese innovation was modern insurance unbundled from credit or investment:In short succession Genoa developed insurance, insurance pools secured by landed estates, and reinsurance. Exchanges sprang up for trading public debt, commodity futures, and other commercial paper. Bankruptcy law and the settlement of international trade disputes reached new levels of sophistication. Accounting became widespread and double-entry bookkeeping was born. As a result of their cumulative breakthroughs in institutions and technology, Europeans became the first merchants to travel and trade around the entire globe.Medieval Genovese merchants, like their Venetian rivals, traveled from Iceland to China. Later Genovese such as Christopher Columbus would lead exploration of the New World.Insurance developed out of an ancient form of marine finance, a loan that only had to be paid back if the ship returned safely:The earliest risk-pooling insurance contracts were structured similarly to, and enforced under the same legal principals as, loans. Indeed they bundled a loan from the combined investor/insurer with an insurance clause -- in the event that the ship was wrecked, the loan need not be paid back. In 14th century Genoa, we see the separation of the investor from the insurer, via a contract with its conditional clause but requiring no initial loan. Investment contracts became separate entities and could be contracted with different parties, greatly improving the spreading of risk for these ventures. Such improved risk management was crucial for the explosion of overseas trade that Europe initiated over the succeeding centuries.One of the most innovative families were the Vivaldis. Frederico Vivaldi was the one of the first merchants to be insured in the new way, and we still have some of his insurance contracts. His ancestors Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi were famous merchants and explorers of the west coast of Africa, pioneering new discoveries and a lucrative trade that would be exploited much more by the Portuguese starting in the 15th century, taking advantage of its naval control over the Straights of Gibraltar (which Genoa never clearly gained, since before the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta Muslims controlled both shores). Today the University of Genoa sits on the Via Vivaldi, named after this most adventurous of families.The Genoan topography helped it protect warehouses full of goods, Genoa's main source of wealth, as well as its populace.Another famous Genovese family was the D'orias. Tedesio D'Oria funded the Vivaldi brothers in their last voyage, an ill-fated attempt at the end of the 13th century to pioneer a route to India -- a feat not accomplished until about two hundred years later by the Portuguese. In the attempt they may have (re)discovered the Canary Islands, which in any case the Genovese would colonize by the middle of the 14th century. Andrea Doria was the most famous Genovese admiral, responsible for defeating the Turks in the naval battle of Lepanto, among other feats.Genoa was also the birthplace of corporations traded by shares, the prototype for the later English joint-stock corporation. Like many of the early English joint-stock companies, most of the Genovese companies were colonial companies that derived their revenue from tribute, tax, and trade from the many colonies they established:The medieval organizations that most resembled later joint-stock corporations were the Genovese maone. These bore some strong resemblances to the publicani tax farming corporations of the Roman Republican era, although it is not clear how they could have survived the intervening Late Empire and Dark Ages other than as very obscure (and perhaps now lost) written descriptions. In form and function maone also bore strong resemblances to some early joint-stock companies such as the Bank of Amsterdam, Bank of England, and the Dutch and English East India Companies.Palazzo San Giorgio (St. George). The Bank of San Giorgio (est. 1407) came to handle most of the municipal debt, providing a prototype for later central banks such as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England.The Italian cities often sold off their tax receivables to wealthy merchants at a discount as a way to borrow funds. (Discounting was one of the many ways late medieval financiers avoided the rather lax and formalistic usury restrictions that remained in Genoa). The debts were divided into equal shares called loca or partes. Legally, these debt shares were personal property (chattels) and could be freely traded.Technically, no organization was created when the city sold its tax receivables to merchants. However, to effectively collect the taxes, the holders of loca formed an organization called a maona or societas comperarum. This organization would then subcontract to tax farmers to collect the taxes. By the fourteenth century, Genovese maone also engaged in military conquest and colonization. These were, quite literally, corporate raiders.Il borsa (the Exchange). Genoa pioneered in issuing and trading shares of ships and of municipal and corporate debt.Normally, maone were temporary, but some of them ended up lasting for a long time. In 1346 the Maona di Chio e di Focea (a company for managing the taxes of Chios and Focea) was formed. This organization's members obtained from Genoa the exclusive right to collect taxes from Chios (an Aegean island) and Phocaea (a port on the Anatolian coast). But first the company would have to conquer them! Although technically a temporary organization, it lasted until 1566.Rather than going to buy receivables from Genoa, subscriptions to the di Chio e di Focea's loca shares (still legally debt, but to be paid out in dividends as taxes and trading revenues were collected) went to fund 29 galleys to conquer Chios and Phocaea. The Genovese Republic, for a fee, granted the organization exclusive rights to collect taxes from the conquered territories as well as special trading privileges. The conquests, taxes, and trading were at least partially successful, and by the 16th century more than 600 persons owned loca of this maona. This function and some of this structure would later be emulated by the Dutch and English India Companies, but with a basic legal difference -- "shares" in these later joint-stock companies would constitute ownership (like ship shares) not debt as with the maona.Genoa was limited in its naval endeavors because Muslims, and then by the end of the 15th century the Portuguese and Spanish, controlled the Straights of Gibraltar. The Genovese nevertheless supplied several leading navigators of the great Age of Exploration, including Nicoloso da Recco, Lanzarotto Malecello, Antoniotto Uso di Mare, Christopher Colombus and probably the Cabots. Its merchants also played a leading role in investing in Spanish and later English endeavors. But with the Reformation the center of commercial innovation would move from Italy to the Netherlands and England. Those innovators stood on the shoulders of giants, and the biggest such giant had been Genoa.Flag with traditional English symbols: gryphons and cross of St. George. More importantly, England borrowed and improved upon many Genovese commercial innovations, ushering in the modern era of global trade and the industrial revolution.England was strongly allied with Genoa throughout much of the Middle Ages. It is thought by some that English symbols such as the Cross of St. George and the gryphon derive from this alliance. English ships flying the Cross of St. George in the Mediterranean were protected by Genovese fleets. More importantly, England derived many of the institutions most critical to the development of overseas trade and colonies and domestic industry from Genoa. England, like the Genovese and Portugal (and unlike many other powers of the time such as China) put their navy primarily on the task of protecting its merchant marine. Its joint stock corporations, many of them colonial, derived from the Genovese colonial companies with their interests divided into shares. Lloyd's of London, with "Names" putting up their estates as collateral for reinsurance, still has the same basic structure as the marine insurance pools pioneered in the 14th century by the Genovese.
Based on yesterday's oral arguments in LabCorp v. Metabolite, Harold Wegner predicts the likelihood that Justice Stevens will write the majority opinion and that this opinion will reverse and remand the case to the Federal Circuit.  That court had held that the patent claim combining a scientific discovery with a prior art blood test was patentable.My observation is that if Stevens,who wrote the old anti-software-patent opinion in Parker v. Flook, keeps to his old (and the Supreme Court's old) philosophy regarding subject matter patentability, and extends his comments beyond "laws of nature" to other expressly forbidden categories (one of which is "algorithms"), there will be fireworks for business method patents and even software patents.  Even if the Court applies a Flook-type methodology without expressly excluding algorithms from the scope of its argument, this could set a very big precedent that could be used to attack software and business method patents.I have previously written about the connection between Metabolite's controversy over patenting "laws of nature" and the origin of software and business method patents.  In the paper "Elemental Subject Matter" I further describe how software came to be patentable despite the express prohibition against patenting "algorithms," and highlight the differences between the Federal Circuit's software-patent-friendly philosophy and Justice Steven's software-patent-hostile philosophy -- a difference of philosophy that easily extends to the "law of nature" at issue in Metabolite, raising the possibility that Metabolite will set a precedent redounding back onto software and business method patents.If Flook is applied in this way to reverse Metabolite, thus creating uncertainty about the validity of software and business method patents, expect a hue and cry among corporate lobbyists here on K Street, resulting in legislation to expressly designate software, business methods, or both as patentable categories of subject matter.There are, however, several other possible rationales for invalidating the patent in Metabolite, so Stevens may have a hard time gathering five votes to apply the Flook methodology here.  Expect the Court's decision in June.
If Mike Huben is saying that the law should be about mechanism, not policy, then I heartily agree.  Yet Mike gets this philosophy blindingly wrong when applying it to the law.It is the highly evolved common law that got this wisdom most right:Contract law: provide mechanisms for making and enforcing contracts, not policy about who can contract with whom for what.Property law: provide mechanisms for transferring, collateralizing, devising, and protecting the quiet use of property, rather than policy dictating who can build what where.Tort law: use the edges or surfaces of the body, property, etc. as boundaries others may not cross without consent of the possessor, rather than dictating detailed rules for each possible harm.Et cetera.  Under the common law we "write" (sometimes literally, as with contracts or wills) the  policy of our own lives.  The common law "create[s] user freedom by allowing them to easily experiment..." as Mike says about X-Windows.  Our judges are supposed to accumulate a common law, and the legislatures write statutes, that are a "systems code" for our interactions with others.   We, by our own agreements with those we specifically deal with, "write" within these basic mechanisms the rules that govern our own interactions with these others.  The guiding philosophy of our legal code should indeed be mechanism, not policy.Of course, law as well as software is not quite this simple, and judges and legislatures sometimes (but not nearly as often as they would like to think) must make some hard policy choices for exceptions and edge cases.  Also, as Mike proves in his essay with absurd and awful statements such as "I think that the rights specified in the Constitution and Bill of Rights are there for purposes of mechanism, not to directly protect individual rights," what is "mechanism" and what is "policy" is often in the mind of the beholder.  In this case, the Founders (which for the Bill of Rights are the anti-Federalists, not generally the Federalists as Mike suggests) clearly had in their minds that the main purpose of the mechanisms was to protect individual rights, especially as those rights had evolved under the common law which Locke and the Constitution summarized as "life, liberty, and property." "Life" and "liberty" occur three times in the Constitution; "property" is protected in four different places.  Mike's beloved welfare state, on the other hand, occurs nowhere in the Constitution.  Much of the Constitution was intended to protect the mechanisms of the common law from the hubristic policymaking of legislatures and the arbitrary actions of government officials.The recent great strides of progress in human history, such as the Industrial Revolution, the Information Revolution, and the abolition of slavery, were propagated by common law countries.  Countries lacking the common law have often fallen into authoritarianism and totalitarianism.  The common law has proven that mechanism, not policy, is a very wise philosophy for law as well as for systems software.  Mechanism, not policy, is a philosophy that all of us should aspire to when opining or voting on laws, and it's a philosophy judges should apply when interpreting them.
When looking at the legal and political history that led up to the formation of the United States of America, judges and historians typically look to English royal and Parliamentary edicts as explanations and precedents for the American government. This is too limited a view. Usually neglected are the unheralded, deep, and indeed often dominant influences on the United States government from medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque-era era corporations.During these eras corporations took a wide variety of forms. Abbeys, monasteries and dioceses were ecclesiastical corporations; boroughs and cities were municipal corporations, and a wide variety of other corporations existed including merchant and trade guilds, universities, and hospitals. Royal law did not make a strong distinction between these different kinds of corporations as our law makes today between, for example, commercial corporations and municipal corporations. They were all "corporations and bodies politick" whose charters used the same basic form and language and which often were granted various degrees of judicial and police powers as property rights appurtenant to or held by the corporation.The Grand Union Flag of the American Revolution and  of the United States as of July 4, 1776For example, the Physician's College in London, a medical guild, was a corporation that had the power (up until the famous case of Dr. Bonham) to imprison anybody practicing medicine without a license within seven miles of the City of London (itself a large political corporation). Nine of the original American colonies were colonial corporations whose charters granted them broad governmental powers subject to retention of "English liberties" by the residents therein and the king's right to collect customs on merchant shipping.   "...one Body corporate and politique in Fact and Name, by the Name of the Governor and Company of the Mattachusetts Bay..." was typical language in these charters.   These corporations were even sometimes (as in this case) sold from one set of investors to another: the modern legal distinction between commercial and political (e.g. municipal) corporations was not yet common.One indicator of the importance of the corporate form are its influences on the titles and symbols adopted by the United States."Citizen" is shorthand for the denizen of a city: a member of a municipal corporation. Members of a king's realm in contrast are called "subjects." "Governors" were groups in charge of corporations (usually corresponding to what in modern U.S. commercial corporations are called "directors," but sometimes, as in many American colonies, singular),  while "presidents" were chief corporate executives who presided over meetings of the governors.  The head of the London College of Physicians for example was its President, and each of the three centers of the East India Company was headed by a President. "Secretaries" (as in Secretary of State, Treasury, Defense, etc.) were corporate managers.The corporate influence went far beyond style to the very structure of our government. Medieval republics usually operated under corporate charters, and English boroughs invariably did so.  These charters were at the same time grants by the king (or treaties with neighboring lord(s)) and agreements among at least a majority of at least one of the "classes" or "houses" of the city. Thus, majority voting (among members of some class, not necessarily all residents), "houses" (often two) which must both agree by majority, and related aspects of our republican government, while often cloaked in classical republican terms, more directly derived from medieval municipal corporations. The idea that a majority can "consent" for other members their class also comes from medieval corporate law (it certainly does not come from contract or tort law). "Constitution" was often used as a synonym for "charter."  The United States Constitution can be profitably viewed as a corporate charter, ratified by a majority of delegates to conventions in each State but shorn of royal imprimatur. "The Queen...grants..." became "We the people of the United States...do ordain and establish."   "We the People" granted rights to ourselves, in some vague collective way.  This makes no sense in legal terms outside the context of corporate charters.Flag of the East India Company, 1707-1802Of course, many titles and symbols did not necessarily have a corporate origin. "Senators" were an oligarchic body from ancient Rome that also existed in some medieval republics. "Congress" is simply derived from the word meaning a gathering, and "legislature" is derived from the Latin "leges" or statutory law. Nevertheless, the United States almost completely eschewed titles from the royal bureaucracy apart from the judicial branch, with its "judges," "justices," and many other titles and symbols, as well as procedural and substantive common law largely derived from the royal common law of England. Other important substantive areas of our constitutional law (e.g. the Bill of Rights) have diverse sources that include Parliamentary statutes and English common law.Even some of our judicial law is however derived from non-royal sources: equity comes from the law exercised by ecclesiastical corporations (canon law), and much of our commercial law derives from the law merchant which developed in franchise merchant courts separately from the royal common law.U.S. judges, justices, and historians thus make a grave mistake when they, to take a currently quite important example, identify the vague "executive power" of Article II with the old prerogatives of the King. The abuse of these prerogatives were one of the major reasons we fought a revolution and gained our independence from the United Kingdom. Given the corporate language and substance of the United States Constitution, it is more accurate to identify the powers of the President, where the Constitution itself is vague on the subject,  with those (a) of the President and the Commander-in-Chief under the Articles of Confederation, and (b) if that is still vague, to those powers granted and reserved by charter to the heads of colonial corporations, in particular the corporate charters of the nine American colonies, (c) if the issue is still uncertain, to corporate law from the Norman Conquest to the Stuarts, and only if all those fail to give an answer to (d) the King whom we rebelled against, and only then if said powers were not one of the stated causes of the rebellion.
This is a post is for those of you who are fellow fans of evolutionary theories of behavior.A genetic strategy has been postulated by evolutionary theorists such as William Hamilton and dubbed by Richard Dawkins the "green beard effect." This effect has been observed in nature, though only rarely has it been clearly distinguished from other recognize-and-discriminate systems.Green beard genes are genes (or more likely small sets of linked genes) that code for the recognition of their presence in other individuals along with discriminatory favoritism of those individuals. Kin altruism, although quite common and treated in this article as a distinct effect, can be thought of as a special case of the green beard effect. In kin altruism genes "recognize themselves" only in probabalistic assemblages, i.e. by degree of kinship (your children and siblings are guaranteed to share 1/2 of your uncommon mutations, nieces and nephews and grandchildren are 1/4 related to you, etc. Note that we are counting new and thus still uncommon mutations, not stable genes: the important question is what will favor or disfavor new mutations. Evolutionary pressure takes ubiquitous genes for granted)."Green beard" is a misleading name as it has led scientists to look for blatant signals, but as I argue below the effects are much more likely to be subtle and parasitical on other kinds of recognition systems. (I don't know to what extent, if any, the following "green beard"/"blue beard" theory of mine is original, as I haven't thoroughly researched this literature and the theory is at least partially suggested by the papers I have read and cite here). Most evolutionary scientists have thought green beard effects would be rare because they have generally not found such blatant signals associated with clear green beard effects and because green beard effects require the simultaneous appearance of three distinct yet genetically linked traits:(1) a detectable feature of the phenotype,(2) the ability to recognize this feature (or the lack of it) in others, AND(3) different behavior towards individuals possessing the feature versus those notThis argument for green beard rarity is flawed, because a wide variety of recognition systems already exist that can readily give rise to green beard genes, some of the main ones being:+ gender recognition and sexual selection (the tendency to prefer some characteristics in mates and avoid others)+ conspecific recognition (distinuishing own species from others)+ kin recognition for kin altruism+ maternal recognition of self vs. fetusLet's call these "normal" recognition systems "blue beards." They are just as blatant or subtle as signals as "green beards." Any recognition system is imperfect: it is coded for by only some of the genes it benefits, and some of these genes will be more strongly linked than others. The more strongly linked genes automatically favor each other: they are green beard genes. Thus, almost any recognize-and-distriminate system can be expected to give rise to the following green beard cycle:(1) green beard genes arise within an existing recognize-and-discriminate system (the blue beard genes) and spread in the population,(2) as the green beard genes spread, the recognition system becomes noisier for unlinked (blue beard) genes,(3) the noise has enough negative impact on unlinked blue beard genes (beneficiaries of the original recognition system) that the blue beard genes develop modifiers to suppress the green beards.Alternatively, the green beard genes might have only a slightly deleterious effect on unlinked genes and thus might succeed. Consider the following hypothetical: a recognition system in a hypothetical cuckoo, a brood parasite, is under genetic pressure to favor blue or green tufts as these are the best ways (and blue is slightly better than green) for our hypothetical cuckoos as adults to recognize each other as distinct from their host species' adults which are red. The gene coding for the green tuft, however, is linked to the recognize-and-discriminate genes while a different gene coding for the blue tuft is unlinked. The green beard effect favors the green tuft even though is is slightly worse than the blue tuft as a signal recognition device.A similar effect might help explain runaway sexual selection for expensive features such as peacock tails: in any sexual selection process, signal genes linked to signal recognition genes will favor each other until they become too expensive for unlinked genes: it's an arms race between the linked green beard genes and the unlinked green beard supression genes, and it may be that full elimination of the green beards is often not the equilibrium. Indeed complete elimination can't be the equilibrium since recognition systems are far from perfect, but almost complete elimination is probably the normal equilibrium. Some examples of exhorbitant display may be green beard genes effects which persist because of the unavailability of mutations for the unlinked genes to modify and thus suppress the green beard genes.We thus can expect a red queen type arms race between green beard genes and the blue beard genes. That is just what has recently been found in the mother-fetus discrimination system (wherein the mother's cells distinguish mother cells from fetus cells and treat them differently). I expect far more effects like these to be found.Sometimes green beard genes exist in equilibrium with a counter-effect such as lethal recessives. This has actually been observed in the red fire ant. In this ant, the kin recognition system, normally used by worker ants to recognize and kill unrelated queens, has given rise to green beard gene(s). One of these genes, a pheremone-coding gene, is always part of the green beard: at this gene locus "bb" is a lethal recessive, but "BB" also turns out to be lethal because "Bb" workers reliably recognize and kill "BB" queens just before they lay their first eggs. Thus "B" and "b" exist in equilibrium.Only a few green beard genes have been observed in nature so far because (1) they are almost always associated with and parasitical on an existing recognize-and-discrimate systems (blue beards), and it is hard for observers to distinguish green beards from blue beards, and (2) they are mostly transient in nature: they are either soon (in evolutionary time) suppressed by blue beard genes or soon come to dominate the population, destroy the original recognition system, and become evolutionarily functionless (i.e. they don't need to code for anything any more once competition is eliminated, so they become just more junk DNA). An equilibrium like that reached in the fire ant will be a rarity.
Several readers have expressed interest in learning some law.  I highly encourage this.  Knowledge of legal basics is not only of great practical use in modern society, it is essential for understanding politics and history, regardless of whether you have any interest in becoming a lawyer.  I will thus be making a number of posts over the next few months discussing a variety of basic legal concepts.   These may include subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, the tort of trespass, contract formation, and a variety of other basic legal ideas.  Today I write about the crucial distinction between procedural and substantive law.Procedural law is about how the law gets passed and enforced: who has jurisdiction over whom, and what coercive processes they may use to bring suspected lawbreakers to justice.  The famous Miranda lines "you have the right to remain silent...." generally uttered in the U.S. when you are arrested are a species of U.S. federal procedural law.   Procedure usually starts in a given case with a great deal of uncertainty and tries to reduce that uncertainty by fairly gathering and evaluating evidence, interpreting the law, and applying those facts to the law to reach legal conclusions.Substantive law involves every law that is not procedural: it is what we normally discuss when talking about law or politics, namely the laws defining and restricting rights and duties for their own sake, not primarily for the sake of enforcing other laws. Thus for example modern property, contract, tort, family, and criminal law are substantive legal areas, as are environmental, workplace, traffic, and most other regulations.   On the other hand, the laws defining who may sue whom and where, and what does and does not constitute proper arrest, interrogation, and search of criminal suspects, are procedural laws.   Historically, just to confuse things a bit, property rights sometimes included rights of coercive procedure, for example the lord who had jurisdiction over his unfree tenants.   This made property law in some cases part of the procedural law as well as a substantive law of economic property.Computer protocols work in layers: wires carry bits of information, and bits of information carry text, pictures, and so on.  The raw bits of information are a lower level protocol that carries the text and pictures in a higher level protocol.   Language works like this too: at the lowest level, paper has letters written on it.  Letters are a lower-level protocol that carries words in a higher level protocol.   You can think of the distinction between substantive and procedural law in the same way: the procedural layer is a lower layer that "carries" the substantive law by specifying how it is to be enforced.We can also think of government and government-like entities as lower levels of the legal protocol.  Indeed, it is very useful to study political structures alongside procedural law.  Think of coercive entities like police and courts as the paper and pencil, procedural law as the letters, and substantive law as the words and sentences we want to make out of these raw materials.
In my last post I introduced dead reckoning as used during the exploration explosion. In this post I will describe the errors these explorers (Dias, Columbus, da Gama, etc.) typically encountered in dead reckoning (DR) when sailing on the oceans, and why dead reckoning could be usefully accurate despite the fact that trying to map those dead reckoning directions onto a normal map would be very inaccurate.To get a taste of the issue, first consider the following abstract navigation problem -- hiking in foggy hills:There are only two useful landmarks, 1F (the origin or "first fix") and 2F (the destination or "second fix").It’s very foggy, so you have no way to use the hills as recognizable features. But the dead reckoning directions are of sufficient accuracy to get you within sight of landmark 2F.  (For simplicity assume 100% accuracy).You don’t know and can’t measure hill slope angles.  Indeed there are only two things the hikers can measure: (a) magnetic compass direction, and (b) distance actually walked. Observe that this is not distance as the crow flies, nor is it distance projected onto the horizontal plane. If a hill happens to be a pyramid, and you happen to be walking straight up it (and thus walking up the hypotenuse of a triangle), the distance measured is the length of the hypotenuse, not the length of the horizontal leg of that triangle. The first person who discovered 2F, starting from 1F, recorded dead reckoning directions to there and back as a sequence of tuples { direction, speed, time }.We can draw a useful head-to-tail diagram of these directions on a piece of paper.  But we can’t use these directions to figure out the distance as the crow flies between 1F and 2F, because we don’t know the slopes of the hills traversed.  And for the purposes of our loose analogy to long-distance ocean navigation, our hikes are short and could be in all steep terrain or all flat, so that over the course of our hike the slopes don’t converge on a knowable average. Since we have insufficient information to determine "crow flight" distances, we don’t have enough information to accurately draw our dead reckoning itinerary on maps as we know them (i.e. Ptolemaic maps).   Yet such faithfully recorded directions are sufficient to get any hiker  (who can also exactly measure bearings and distances) from 1F to 2F and back.Most maps as we know them – Ptolemaic maps -- are projections from a sphere to a Euclidean plane based on lines of latitude and longitude where lines of longitude converge at the celestial poles.   Latitude is determined by measuring the altitude of a celestial object, and latitude is also ultimately defined by what navigators call the celestial sphere (although by "Ptolemaic map" I will refer to any map that shows actual earth surface distances proportionately on the map, i.e. "to scale"). There are also non-Ptolemaic maps, for example subway maps, which show the topological relationships between entities but not proportional distances. This chart of the kind Zheng He may have used, or was drawn using information from those or similar voyages, was of such a topological nature (the west coast of India is along the top and the east coast of Africa is along the bottom): A set of dead reckoning directions can be diagrammed.  But although it contains more information than a subway map, it doesn’t contain enough information to plot on a Ptolemaic map.  Thus like a subway map this dead reckoning "space" cannot be accurately projected, or "mapped" in mathematical terminology, onto a normal (Ptolemaic) map without further information. A subway map is in no way "to scale": the distances on are not proportional to any measured values.  By contrast a dead reckoning map can be drawn "to scale" in its own distinct Euclidan plane.  But not only cannot this dead reckoning space without further information be accurately projected (i.e. projected with proportions intact or "to scale") onto a Ptolemaic map, but two different dead reckoning itineraries drawn on a  Euclidean plane will also generally be in error relative to each other, as I will describe below.  And now to the central point I want to get across in this article: these two kinds of errors -- from trying to Ptolemaically map a dead reckoning itinerary on the one hand and between two dead reckoning itineraries on the other hand -- are very different.  They are quite distinct in kind and usually produce errors of very different magnitudes.The unknown values ignored in a dead reckoning itinerary, analogous to the hill slopes in the scenario above, can be any spatially variable but temporally constant distances, directions, or vectors that are unknown to the navigators writing and following the directions.  The three most important spatially variable but temporally constant sets of vectors generally unknown to or ignored by dead reckoners on ocean and sea voyages from the 13th century through the era of the exploration explosion were were magnetic variation (shown below as green arrows), current (red arrows), and curvature of the earth (ignored in this post, but the same argument applies).  Since these temporally constant but spatially variable factors (analogous to the slopes of our foggy hills) were unknown or ignored, they had no way to map such pure dead reckoning directions onto a Ptolemaic map.  The information they rigorously measured and recorded for the purposes of dead reckoning was insufficient for that purpose.  Yet that information was sufficient to enable navigators to retrace their steps (to get back on course if blown off course) or follow a previously recorded dead reckoning itinerary (or a nearby course, as I'll show below) with usefully small error.Temporally constant but spatially variable vectors shown on a diagram.  Only the dead reckoning (DR) vectors are shown added head-to-tail, since these are all the dead reckoning navigator  in the exploration explosion era usually measured.  The vectors shown here are magnetic variation (green) and current (red).  Since these vectors were unknown, dead reckoning directions could not be accurately plotted on a Ptolemaic map. Curvature of the earth, not shown here, is also temporally constant and can thus also be ignored for the purposes of dead reckoning.However some kinds of dead reckoning errors were due to unknowns variables that changed over time. These produced small but cumulative errors in dead reckoning even for the purposes of specifying repeatable directions. Errors in measuring bearing, speed, and time were of this nature. Externally, different winds required different tacking angles, creating "leeway", where the boat moves not straight forward but at an angle. If the directions don’t account for this, or account for it imperfectly, there will necessarily be a cumulative error. It was thus important to "fix" on landmarks or soundings. The more accuracy needed (such as when approaching shorelines, much more hazardous than open-ocean sailing), the more often fixes had to be taken. I hope to say more about fixes and temporally variable errors in future posts. This post is about dead reckoning between two fixes and errors that vary spatially but can be reasonably treated as constant in time.A dead reckoning diagram made on a chart, with "fixes" or adjustments (dashed line)s to a landmark or sounding (yellow "X") diagrammed on the chart. The start and end of points of the voyage are also landmarks, so there is also a fix for the final landmark.  Note that the chart still does not have to be Ptolemaic for this purpose -- the fixes need not be shown with proportionally correct distances to each other. Indeed the Zheng He era chart above is roughly in this form, with only one crude dead reckoning vector between each fix: it labels each arc with a crude time or distance estimate along with a (much more accurate) bearing estimate, but like a subway map it doesn't care about showing distances as proportional. When sailing over continental shelves, European mariners (and sometimes Chinese mariners) of that era took "soundings" that measured depth and sampled the bottom soil, creating a unique signature of { depth, soil type} that functioned like landmarks but on open ocean.  Soundings could be taken when sailing over the relatively shallow areas of continental shelves.  As you can see, most parts of the oceans are too deep for this, but most shorelines are fronted by at least a few miles of soundable shelf, and sometimes hundreds of miles.  Soundings were very useful for navigating in clouds, fog, and at night far enough away from the shore to avoid the hazards of very shallow water, yet close enough for the water to be shallow enough to sound.  Pilots that used soundings thus had a set of "landmarks" for fixing their dead reckoning directions that allowed them to avoid hazardous navigation too close to land.Notice that these kinds of fixes still do not give Ptolemaic coordinates -- they simply map or "fix" a particular point in our dead reckoning "space" to a particular point on the earth's surface of unknown Ptolemaic (celestial) coordinates, and indeed of unknown distances relative to other fixes.(Side note -- explorers between Cao and Magellan usually could not get a celestial "fix" on a rolling deck of sufficient accuracy to be useful, i.e. more accurate than their dead reckoning -- and even in the case of Magellan this was only useful because there was nothing better, dead reckoning errors having accumulated to very high levels by the time they were in the mid-Pacific.  So like them we will have to ignore this way, both more ancient and more modern, but generally unused during the exploration explosion, of correcting DR errors at sea).It's all fine and good for dead reckoning to provide, as shown above, repeatable directions to a destination, despite being Ptolemaically unmappable, when the same itinerary is exactly repeated.  But the best itinerary over the oceans depends on the wind.  These winds vary, and the early explorers of new oceans searched for the best courses and seasons in order to catch the best winds.  So the early explorers usually did not exactly repeat dead reckonings recorded on prior voyages.  They usually took courses a few hundred miles away from the prior voyages' itinerary in order to catch more favorable winds.  So the question arises: if the navigator adjusts his course by a few hundred miles, roughly what amount of resulting error should the navigator generally expect.(BTW, it us  important to note that dead reckoning directions, while they did not have to account for currents, magnetic variation, and the curvature of the earth, for the reasons given in this article, did have to account for variations in winds and the related leeway from tacking, since these reasons do not apply to vectors with substantial temporal variability.  So we assume, as the navigators themselves probably did in some fashion, that the velocity vectors in our dead reckoning itineraries aren't strictly those measured, but are those measurements adjusted for variations in wind).To reiterate the most important point: this is a different question than the question of what the error is when plotted on a normal map.  Historians trying to recreate these voyages, in order to figure out where their landfalls were, or plot them on maps, or to estimate what navigational acccuracy of European navigators achieved in that era, usually haven't understood this crucial distinction. Indeed, because currents and magnetic variation don't in most places in the open ocean change in extreme or sudden ways, the resulting errors in dead reckoning navigation tended to be much smaller than the errors when plotting the dead reckoning directions on a Ptolemaic map. If you can scrutinize some more complicated diagrams I can demonstrate this by example here. First consider two dead reckoning itineraries, unadjusted for current and magnetic variation and thus plotted non-Ptolemaically:Black = DR velocity in given time periodRed = average current velocity in given time periodGreen = average magnetic variation in given time periodA, B = Two different DR itineraries as recorded (i.e. not adjusted for unknown magnetic variation and current). B has different first and third leg plus different currents on last two legs (only DR measurements added head-to-tail) – navigator would not actually plot these on a chart of geographic location, or at least would not consider such plotting accurate.1F, 2F = first fix, next fix (same in each case, but their geographical location doesn’t need to be known)For simplicity I am treating magnetic variation as uniform and spatially varying only the current, but the same argument I make here applies even more strongly to magnetic variation (and even more strongly to curvature of the earth, which can be treated as another set of vectors).  The second fix (2F) has a question mark in front of it to indicate that the second itinerary (B) won't actually arrive at the same spot as A arrives at -- due to the different currents it encounters, it will arrive at a different spot.  We assume, as was usually the case out of sight of shore, that our early explorer doesn't know the current.  But the explorer did want to know, as historians want to know: roughly how large can such errors in typical oceans be expected to be?  To demonstrate the mathematics of this, I've created a Ptolemaic map of the itineraries (dashed lines) by adding in the currents and magnetic variations head-to-tail.  I've also superimposed the original non-Ptolemaic diagram (just the dead reckoning vectors added up) to show the much larger error that occurs when trying to project that onto a Ptolemaic map.A‘, B’ = A and B adjusted to show difference in geographic location (all vectors added head-to-tail). The navigator in Columbus’ day could not usally compute these, since he typically did not know the current and magnetic variation values. NA, NB = net effect of spatially variable but temporally constant current on geographic (i.e. Ptolemaic or celestial) location. Error if unadjusted itineraries Ptolemaically mapped. Separate red arrow diagram shows the same net effect of the two separate sets of currents.Dashed blue line next to 2F = actual navigator’s error of two DR itineraries against each other when neither set of itineraries adjusts for current or magnetic variation. The next fix lies somewhere on this line, assuming no other errors.(BTW if you can copy and paste arrows it's easy to make your own examples).As you can see, the errors (solid blue lines labeled NA and NB) from trying to superimpose the non-Ptolemaic dead reckoning itineraries (solid lines) on the Ptolemaic map are much larger than the actual error (dashed blue line labeled 2F) that occurs from following itinerary A instead of B or vice versa (shown on dashed lines when adjusted for current.  The magnetic variation is held constant, but the same argument applies to that, and to the curvature of the earth.Note that the error in locating our second fix 2F is simply the same as the difference between the two separately added sets of current vectors:It would be instructive to create a computer simulation of this which plugs in actual values (which we now know in excrutiating detail) for current, magnetic variation, and curvature of the earth.
There are many great ideas that have been worked on in the cryptographic theory community that I've long wanted to see implemented in practical tools.  Two of these, mathematically deniable authentication and forward secrecy, have now been implemented along with encryption by Ian Goldberg and Nikita Borisov to create the off-the-record messaging software OTR.  Now you can have a conversation on the Internet as if it was just you and your buddy on a golf course.  You do have to trust that your buddy on the golf course is not wearing a wire, and here Alice has to trust that Bob is not recording the conversation and vice versa.  With mathematical deniability, even if your chat buddy records the conversation, third parties cannot mathematically prove that it was you doing the chatting.  This is of limited practicality for legal purposes unless you use OTR via an onion router or similar: otherwise there is enough associated log data to prove Bob's identity in court even if mathematically it could be forged.  Even an onion router won't save you if you leave identifying information in the actual conversation and your chat buddy records the conversation.  This is because the laws of evidence typically put the burden of proving that such recorded data was forged on the person it is being used against.  Nevertheless, in the normal course of operations presumably OTR lives up to its name and does not record the conversation, and your chat buddy would have to go way out of his way to make it do so.Of more practical use is the forward secrecy, which means that if your chat today is recorded by a third party in the encrypted form over which it is sent across the Internet, and that third party discovers your chat key in the future, that key can't be used to compromise the recorded but encrypted message.  "Forward secrecy" means the key you used was destroyed after use, (like on Mission Impossible but automatically instead of with the self-destruct sequence drama), and even if future key(s) are compromised they can't be used to reconstruct the current key, and thus can't be used to decipher the current chat session.This presentation gives a good overview of the messaging software's rationale and the basics of how mathematically deniable authentication and forward secrecy work.  It points out that the law endorses off-the-record phone conversations: normally and in most jurisdictions recording phone conversations without consent is illegal.  Cryptography, for the limited problems it actually solves, is far more secure than the law.
A small-game fallacy occurs when game theorists, economists, or others trying to apply game-theoretic or microeconomic techniques to real-world problems, posit a simple, and thus cognizable, interaction, under a very limited and precise set of rules, whereas real-world analogous situations take place within longer-term and vastly more complicated games with many more players: "the games of life".  Interactions between small games and large games infect most works of game theory, and much of microeconomics, often rendering such analyses useless or worse than useless as a guide for how the "players" will behave in real circumstances. These fallacies tend to be particularly egregious when "economic imperialists" try to apply the techniques of economics to domains beyond the traditional efficient-markets domain of economics, attempting to bring economic theory to bear to describe law, politics, security protocols, or a wide variety of other institutions that behave very differently from efficient markets. However as we shall see, small-game fallacies can sometimes arise even in the analysis of some very market-like institutions, such as "prediction markets."Most studies in experimental economics suffer from small-game/large-game effects. Unless these experiments are very securely anonymized, in a way the players actually trust, and in a way the players have learned to adapt to, overriding their moral instincts -- an extremely rare circumstance, despite many efforts to achieve this -- large-game effects quickly creep in, rendering the results often very misleading, sometimes practically the opposite of the actual behavior of people in analogous real-life situations. A common example: it may be narrowly rational and in accord with theory to "cheat", "betray", or otherwise play a narrowly selfish game, but if the players may be interacting with each other after the experimenters' game is over, the perceived or actual reputational effects in the larger "games of life", ongoing between the players in subsequent weeks or years, may easily exceed the meager rewards doled out by the experimenters to act selfishly in the small game. Even if the players can somehow be convinced that they will remain complete strangers to each other indefinitely into the future, our moral instincts generally evolved to play larger "games of life", not one-off games, nor anonymous games, nor games with pseudonyms of strictly limited duration, with the result that behaving according to theory must be learned: our default behavior is very different. (This explains, why, for example, economics students typically play in a more narrowly self-interested way, i.e. more according to the simple theories of economics, than other kinds of students).Small-game/large-game effects are not limited to reputational incentives to play nicer: moral instincts and motivations learned in larger games also include tribal unity against perceived opponents, revenge, implied or actual threats of future coercion, and other effects causing much behavior to be worse than selfish, and these too can spill over between the larger and smaller games (when, for example, teams from rival schools or nations are pitted against each other in economic experiments). Moral instincts, though quite real, should not be construed as necessarily or even usually being actually morally superior to various kinds of learned morals, whether learned in economics class or in the schools of religion or philosophy.Small-game/large-game problems can also occur in auditing, when audits look at a particular system and fail to take into account interactions that can occur outside their system of financial controls, rendering the net interactions very different from what simply auditing the particular system would suggest. A common fraud is for trades to be made outside the scope of the audit, "off the books", rendering the books themselves very misleading as to the overall net state of affairs.Similarly, small-game/large-game problems often arise when software or security architects focus on an economics methodology, focusing on the interactions occurring within the defined architecture and failing to properly take into account (often because it is prohibitively difficult to do so) the wide variety of possible acts occurring outside the system and the resulting changes, often radical, to incentives within the system. For example, the incentive compatibility of certain interactions within an architecture can quickly disappear or reverse when opposite trades can be made outside the system (such as hedging or even more-than-offsetting a position that by itself would otherwise create a very different incentive within the system), or when larger political or otherwise coercive motivations and threats occur outside the analyzed incentive system, changing the incentives of players acting within the system in unpredictable ways. Security protocols always consist of at least two layers: a "dry layer" that can be analyzed by the objective mathematics of computer science, and a "wet layer" that consists of the often unpredictable net large-game motivations of the protocols' users.  These should not be confused, nor should the false precision of mathematical economic theories be confused with the objective accuracy of computer science theories, which are based on the mathematics of computer architecture and algorithms and hold regardless of users' incentives and motivations.A related error is the pure-information fallacy: treating an economic institution purely as an information system, accounting only for market-proximate incentives to contribute information via trading decisions, while neglecting how that market necessarily also changes players' incentives to act outside of that market. For example, a currently popular view of proposition bets, the "prediction markets" view, often treats prop bets or idea futures as purely information-distribution mechanisms, with the only incentives supposed as the benign incentive to profit by adding useful information to the market. This fails to take into account the incentives such markets create to act differently outside the market.  A "prediction market" is always also one that changes incentives outside that market: a prediction market automatically creates parallel incentives to bring about the predicted event. For example a prediction market on a certain person's death is also an assassination market. Which is why a pre-Gulf-War-II DARPA-sponsored experimental "prediction market" included a prop bet on Saddam Hussein's death, but excluded such trading on any other, more politically correct world leaders. A sufficiently large market predicting an individual's death is also, necessarily, an assassination market, and similarly other "prediction" markets are also act markets, changing incentives to act outside that market to bring about the predicted events.
A draft of my paper "History and the Security of Property" is available.  I'd love to get your comments.
A new era of commercial gigaprojects is upon us, and the source is almost entirely our insatiable demand for hydrocarbons.  Despite high political risks, global warming and "peak oil" fears, and shortages of skilled employees, there are dozens of energy-related projects in the works or on the drawing boards in the multi-billion dollar range, with several topping $10 billion.  Is it the sign of a petroleum bubble, or does it simply reflect the new reality of a long-term higher worldwide demand for hydrocarbons?   Here are some of the more interesting projects.  Note that  the dollar cost of these projects is often a bit higher than quoted here because of depreciation of the dollar versus most currencies since the cost quotes in my sources were made.One of the biggest expansions into relatively new territory is that of tar sands.  It is estimated that over $100 billion will be invested in Canadian tar sands projects over the next decade.   Two of these projects are Petro-Canada's Fort Hills Project($25 billion) and the Chinese/Canadian Northern Lights Project ($4.5 billion).Many of the biggest projects are to extract natural gas (methane).  $11 billion of investment was recently completed for Qatargas II, and China is cooperating with Iran on the $16 billion project to develop the Iranian North Pars field.  Woodside Corp.'s $9 billion investment in the Pluto project is expected to eventually top out at over $30 billion.  Sakhalin 2 is a $20 billion project of Shell and Gazprom to extract oil and gas from beneath the coast of Sakhalin Island, along the east coast of Russia.Oil tends to be a bit more dispersed than natural gas, and consequently inidividual oil projects tend to be smaller.  But in total, OPEC countries have projects underway or plans for $254 billion worth of oil field development and expansion.   The largest projects tend to be pipelines: a proposed pipeline from Siberia to China and the Sea of Japan for $12-$16 billion, Malaysia wants to build a $7 billion pipeline to save oil tankers from the troubles and risks of sailing through the Straits of Malacca, and a $4 billion pipeline is being built between Chad and Cameroon.   But other oil-related gigaprojects are in the works.  Kuwait is planning a $14 billion monster oil refinery.  CONOOC and Shell have agreed to build a $4.3 billion plastics (ethylene and propylene) factory in Guandong Province, China.   Investors have ponied up more than $1 billion simply to search for oil in New Zealan's Great South Basin.  And oil revenues have allowed Saudi Arabians to dream of building a city from scratch for a cool $26 billion.   But topping our list of gigaprojects, the overall cost of developing the Kashagan fields in Kazakhistan is now estimated at $136 billion, which may make it economically unviable.Meanwhile, there are also numerous offshore oil operations being developed in the $500 million - $2 billion range, with a few such projects (such as the Hebron field off Newfoundland, $5.6 billion) surpassing that range. More on deep sea projects -- now including not just oil, but diamonds and other minerals -- here.
I've written about geographic patterns that demonstrate the importance of securing as well as producing wealth (link below). These have shaped forms of government and law. Hunter-gatherer tribes, under which our instincts evolved, had no need of large organizations, governments, or law as we know it. The dawn of agriculture was probably made possible, not by the discovery that food plants could be grown from seeds (this would have been obvious to a hunter-gatherer), but in solving the much harder problem of how to protect this capital investment over the course of a planting-growing-harvesting-storage cycle from fellow human beings. This required internal law and external security exercised much more thoroughly and over a larger area. It was securing the production, more than the production itself, that required eventually radical organizational evolution.Once farmland became the main source of wealth, there were substantial economies of scale in protecting it. This posed a difficulty in forming organizations larger than tribes; those cultures that could coordinate larger militaries slowly displaced tribes that could not. This led to a wide variety of governmental forms, but they tended to have in common that the military consumed the bulk of the otherwise insecure agricultural surplus. The primary legal form was that of real property, usually claimed by military lords and their heirs.The next phase appeared sporadically and temporarily among city-states that dealt most in goods (included harvested and transportable agricultural commodities) rather than farmland. As cultures became centered around trade and industry, converting from farmland to goods as the main source of wealth, they also tended to convert to from feudal monarchies to republics (or as we tend to call them now, democracies). Contract law became as or more important than real property law. Real property became much more alienable, either sold outright or pledged as security for insurance or investments.As most wealth became mobile, taxes became centered on trade and income -- on wealth transfers that require crossing borders or crossing trust barriers -- rather than on wealth. During the same centuries as the rise of republics, cheap paper made widespread monolinguistic merchant communities more effective. The printing press gave rise to modern national languages, making large-scale organizations such as the modern corporation and nation-state possible. This led to substantial efficiency gains both in the security of production (and of the accompanying trade) as well as in the production and trade themselves.Technology and economy have now once again leapt ahead of government and law: now in the most developed countries it's no longer goods, but services and information, which increasingly create wealth. It's still almost anybody's guess what organizational forms will be needed to produce and secure service value and information wealth, and for that matter whether such wealth will take the legal forms that have appeared with goods-centered republics (e.g. patents and copyrights) or whether new more security-efficient forms of property and contract will emerge. I expect smart contracts and related protocols to play an important role.More about security and history here.

Here are some considerations that went into the design of Juristopia. The overall goal of Juristopia is to improve the most important functions of government (especially defense and the abatement of public nuisances) while preventing the corruption, oppression, war, genocide, and other abuses that have so often come with police powers and taxation. Those evils have been particularly prone to occur when those powers are bundled into a locus of sovereignty, a la the personal totalitarianism of the Justinian Code, Bodin, and Hobbes or the parliamentary totalitarianism of Bagehot. These traditions of legal procedure, assuming political relationships are a matter of delegation rather than of property, have given us almost all of the worst in Western history: the Caesars, the Tsars, Napoleon, the Kaisers, the communist dictators, Mussolini, Franco, and Hitler among others -- based on the profoundly false and destructive assumption, derived from the legal procedure of the Roman Empire, that there must be "one person" who is "responsible" for all politics and law -- a person or (for Bagehot) small organization sitting at the top of a vast pyramid of principal-agent, usually boss-employee, relationships.   Although it discards totalitarian political structure and legal procedure, our proposed form of government is based on historically proven legal mechanisms. With the clarity of legal procedure it avoids the vague nonsense that often passes for political philosophy. Much of the political structure of Juristopia is based on highly evolved common law mechanisms such as property and contract, but these are used in the same basic manner as in the common law, rather than as misleading analogies or mere labels.  Nor is there any hand-waving about how "the market" will magically produce efficient law.  An efficient market is an outcome, not a cause, of good law.  Some kinds of legal competition are good and some are pathological: Juristopia encourages the former and strongly discourages the latter.  Juristopia borrows from a number of historical political and legal systems, ranging from the modern constitutional administrative state to the monarcho-franchise system of late medieval England.  Important design themes of Juristopia include separation and decentralization of powers. Its central design theme is the replacement of most delegation relationships (i.e. principle-agent or boss-employee) in politics with property and peer contract relationships. In its radical unbundling of power it satisfies many of the ideals of green libertarianism, minarchism and even anarcho-capitalism, yet it retains and even enhances the valuable functionality of modern government, such as environmental protection and defense. It strongly encourages the healthy legal competition that occurs before any dispute has arisen, such as choice of law and choice of forum, but severely discourages the unhealthy forum shopping that occurs after an injury has already taken place. It thus provides both default jurisdictions and the ability of parties to opt out of them, for future disputes between themselves, by contract.The main innovations of Juristopia are (1) to revive a kind of jurisdiction that was once a strong bulwark against totalitarianism, namely jurisdictions held as property rather than by delegation, and (2) to combine these with the recently more common bulwarks against totalitarianism, especially separation of powers and a Bill of Rights defining limits on the exercise of franchise powers against individuals.The result might be called, to borrow some computer science lingo, a microkernel government. A microkernel in a computer is a small program that contains only the most essential functions needed to manage a large number of other programs called "servers" that are conceptually independent of each other. Similarly, our governmental microkernel provides only the miniminum procedural functionality needed to handle franchises, a wide variety of which in turn handle the substantive law. Many of the advantages listed by Wikipedia for microkernel programs point up analogous advantages of microkernel government:* "security: it is more secure as more operations are done in user mode than in kernel mode" -- similarly, the failure of one governmental function is much less likely to spill over into other functions or to cause general political failure. And since a small franchise requires fewer powers than a large government, any abuses of its powers are likely to be far less severe.* "reliability: a simpler kernel design and functionality typically results in a more reliable operating system" -- similarly, the compartmentalization produced by property rather than delegation relationships increases the reliability of each function.* "flexibility: new features can be added and unnecessary ones can be removed. This makes it suitable for both large and small systems" -- similarly, to add or remove a governmental function requires merely defining and funding a new franchise, or for a jury to defund it.* "portability: most of the processor-specific code is in the microkernel, which makes it easier to port the kernel to a new platform" -- similarly, our new form of government can be applied in a wide variety of contexts -- as a new commercial jurisdiction, as the basis for an online game, or to augment or replace a traditional government.As a final note, although decentralization is a key feature, this decentralization is generally one of subject matter rather than territory. Territory is far less important in Juristopia than it is in most of today's governments. Its federalism and localism takes the form of unbundling jurisdiction by subject matter rather than by territory.   It is expected that franchises will operate over large territories and even globally.   The physical boundaries of its jurisdiction will depend on its function and won't necessarily bear any relationship to the boundaries of other franchises.  Indeed, Juristopia goes much farther than most forms of government in unbundling territory from government, thereby reducing the legal transaction costs of operating in multiple territories and increasing the healthy forms of legal competition.(BTW, please let me know which spelling you prefer:  :-)
1891, British armed forces stationed in (undivided) India: 90,666Population of undivided India: 287, 223, 431Number of Indians per British soldier: 3,1682006, American troops stationed in Iraq: c. 150,000Population of Iraq: 26,074,906Number of Iraqis per American soldier: 174More here. The ratio of Indians to soldiers of British origin was even higher under the old British East India Company. Furthermore, even though the British East India Company, and later the British Crown, unified and controlled and radically changed the government of India, British civil service in India "had a maximum strength of little more than a thousand," according to Niall Ferguson's colorful book Empire. It's no longer our highly educated and culturally unified mercenaries taking sides in wars between badly divided and largely illiterate native polities, as during the colonial era. National sympathies, stemming mainly from ties of a written language and shared religion, now unify millions of people at a time into cohesive, educated, and highly motivated political blocs that we try to control at our peril. The sophisticated communications and financial networks such nations set up (even if they are stateless) cannot be disrupted for long. A small subset of such megagroups who have particularly strong views can, on the other hand, now severly disrupt traditional occupation and traditional government. It's not now and never was a problem of "not enough troops on the ground." We are already deploying far more troops in Iraq than is historically normal for a successful overseas occupation. If we continue to try to play Empire, or even just world policeman, it will destroy us.
From Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority:In all cases of property rights there is a defined space, whether a namespace or physical space, and the task is to agree on simple attributes of or rights to control subdivisions of that space. In some cases a name or other symbol corresponds to a person or object owned or controlled by that person. For example, Internet users must agree on which domain name corresponds to which web site operator. In other cases we are simply concerned with control over a subdivision of the space. With real estate we must agree on who owns various rights (to occupy the surface, to mine the minerals under, etc.) to a piece of land. With radio spectrum we must agree on who owns what range of frequencies and in what physical space (or transmitting power as an easily observed approximation of physical space used)....all such [multiparty problems of] control over the semantics of symbols, to be made and respected across trust boundaries, are problems of agreeing on and maintaining property rights......New advances in replicated database technology will give us the ability to securely maintain and transfer ownership for a wide variety of kinds of property, including not only land but chattels, securities, names, and addresses. This technology will give us public records which can "survive a nuclear war", along the lines of the original design goal of the Internet. While thugs can still take physical property by force, the continued existence of correct ownership records will remain a thorn in the side of usurping claimants...The ideal title database would have the following properties:(1) Current owner Alice should be able transfer her title to only a single relying counterparty (similar to the "double spending" problem in digital cash)(2) Servers should not be able to forge transfers(3) Servers should not be able to block transfers to or from politically incorrect parties....Using these results [of Byzantine quorum systems] it looks like we can approach our ideal title database as follows:(1) Alice signs the title and Bob's public key, and sends this message to 2f+1 servers, committing her to transfer title to Bob. Bob checks at least 2f+1 servers before relying on Alice's transfer.(2) No collusion of servers can forge Alice's signature (we achieve at least this property ideally!)(3) A conspiracy of >=(1/4)n servers can block a transfer. Alice's recourse is to use some other channels to broadcast her intention, demonstrating that the registry did not follow her wishes, and hoping the alternative channels are more reliable. Bob only has similar recourse if he signed a document with Alice demonstrating their intentions to transfer title from Alice to Bob. The most basic recourse is a correct subset of servers which exits the property club and establishes a new one, then advertises its correctness (and proves the incorrectness of its rival group) as described above.More here.
What has caused the recent and unprecedented housing inflation, rendering houses less affordable in the U.S. than they've been for over a century? Almost surely the answer is the recent rapid increase in zoning and code regulations, driven by coalitions of homeowners under the aegis of Baby Boomer environmentalist and smart growth ideology. Much of the extra costs go to "architects" who must be paid to approve both new housing and additions, but much also come from severe restrictions, for example on height, and from vast areas of land simply being put off-limits to housing. The result is a large benefit to homeowners who sell or get equity loans, but an even larger loss to non-owners who would like to purchase, including millions of people stuck in substandard or cramped housing and over a million outright homeless.This study, among many other studies and observations, shows a strong correlation between local regulations and local housing prices. The correlation between housing prices and other plausible variables, such as density, is by contrast relatively weak. A reaction which purports to solve the housing costs problem, while actually making it worse, is inclusionary zoning, which more than tripled in California between 1990 and 2003.See also my previous post on rent-seeking coalitions at the national level.(Click to enlarge. The following graphs come from the above-cited study).
Jurisdiction is the legal right of  a court to order coercive process: to imprison a person, to put them on trial, to punish criminals, and to require plaintiffs with a variety of remedies (ranging from payment of damages to injunctions) at the expense of defendants. Subject matter jurisdiction is the areas of law over which a court may legally assert jurisdiction, and personal jurisdiction is those persons over which a court may assert jurisdiction.The question of which court has jurisdiction is in theory independent of the question of which law will be applied ("choice of law" or "conflict of laws"), though they for various practical reasons they are often in fact intertwined.Jurisdiction comes in three basic forms:(1) Sovereign government. This is what we were taught in high school civics class -- courts have jurisdiction over us because -- well, because they're "the government," that's why. Many people now consider this the only kind of jurisdiction. However, historically sovereign jurisdiction had its origin in a much more general kind of jurisdiction:(2) Property. One owns jurisdiction over certain subject matters, and exercises that jurisdiction over certain tenants or visitors to one's franchise territory, based on conditions in the property deed or covenant. Often the franchise territory is simply the territory of the land one owns and to which the franchise is attached, but the charter defining the franchise could specify a different territory. The largest jurisdiction is the realm itself, the jurisdiction owned by the king, and consisting of all jurisdiction in the realm not owned by others in the form of a granted or prescriptive franchise. Jurisdiction as property was historically often associated with feudal or colonial government, but the degree of decentralization possible varied radically. In its more decentralized forms (such as those of medieval Iceland, and to a lesser extent medieval and Renaissance England) this is a radically different model of jurisdiction than that based on sovereign government. More here.(3) Contract. This has been common in various times and places, and is on the rise in many parts of the modern world in the form of choice of law and choice of forum clauses (often called "arbitration clauses" because they often specify a private arbitrator instead of a state court). Contractual jurisdiction works much better for relational disputes than for torts between strangers. Conceivably, however, a network of contracts in which people agree to delegate consent to jurisdiction could grow dense enough to cover most or even all persons who might contact each other. There are however no modern examples of this. Medieval Iceland has sometimes been interpreted as an example of universal contract-based jurisdiction, but is better viewed as a hybrid property/contract system, since it was based on a franchise-like property right called a "godord."The U.S. Supreme Court splits on its justifications for why a state may exercise of broad jurisdiction. The view of conservative justices is just that states are sovereign over their territories, period. If the state "tags" you inside its territory you are "it" in their courts for any amount of liability, even if you were just passing through. Liberal justices have justified state jurisdiction as a kind of restitution or implied contract, described further below. Under both views you can also be hauled in from outside the state if you had "minimal contacts" with that state, for example shipping a product there.Thoughtful political and legal scholars have long recognized that jurisdiction requires much more than brute force assertion: it requires some kind of consent of the governed. Legal scholar Lysander Spooner long ago debunked the idea that government is a "social contract" that you and I actually agreed to abide by. Neither you nor I have ever agreed to any such thing by any process resembling that of formation in contract law. The liberal justices dredge up a similar argument: by entering a state territory and performing some minimal act, such as driving on the roads, you have "availed" yourself of the protections of that jurisdiction. By driving on the road, for example, you have availed yourself of the "significant benefit" of police services, and thereby have now subjected yourself to the full sovereign jurisdiction of that state -- even if that puts you in jeopardy of a penalty far out of proportion to any benefit you have obtained, and even if the penalty is for something completely unrelated to the benefit.For example, let's say you were married and living in New Jersey and your spouse ran off to California with the kids. You visit California for three days to see the children.Both the liberals and conservative justices in the U.S. agree that your spouse can greatly extend your stay by hauling you into California court to dissolve your New Jersey marriage and split up your New Jersey property. But they agree on this grotesque idea for different reasons.According to the conservatives, California is sovereign and can simply can tag you because you are in their territory. According to the liberal justices, you have "availed" yourself of the "significant benefits" of the California laws by driving on California roads, and thereby justified California gaining control over your marriage, your children, and your property. (The actual case was Burnham v. Superior Court of California, 495 U.S. 604 (1990)).One cannot rebut the conservatives because they just make a raw assertion: a conclusory statement, not an argument. Your spouse simply needs to file a complaint and serve you with process in California territory: tag and you're it. Stay away from your spouse and kids and your New Jersey marriage and New Jersey property are safe from the tender mercies of the California courts. Take one step inside and it's all up for grabs.The shallowness of the liberals' pseudo-contractual argument can be seen by translating it to an actual contractual setting. Suppose you stepped onto a car lot called Mike's Maserati Mecca and were talked into test driving that slick silver bullet you certainly can't afford. After a thoroughly enjoyable ride with Mike, in which you consented to follow his directions and availed yourself of the significant benefits of his hospitality, Mike presented you with a contract from the back office. He then declared that, by driving the car, you thereby agreed to buy it. The price is the standard market price, but that doesn't mean that you can afford it. Call it a "drive-wrap contract."No court anywhere I know of would enforce this "contract": your small act of stepping into the car dealer's territory, availing yourself of property protected by Mike's security guard, and even the somewhat larger and related act of test-driving his car, in no way could be construed as consent to "rules of the territory" that include an obligation to purchase the car. Many courts have a derogatory name for this: "officious intermeddling." Another example: if the neighbor kid shows up one day and simply starts mowing your lawn, there is no implied contract whereby you owe the kid the typical price of a mown law. You may be morally or reputationally obligated in your neighborhood, depending on its norms, but it is not a legal obligation. The only vaguely analogous situation where a court will allow a person to force a contract with you is if you are completely incapacitated and desperately in need a help: if a doctor helps you, a typical court will construe the existence of a contract to pay the doctor a reasonable fee, because that is what you almost surely would have agreed to had you been conscious. This implied-in-law contract is also often called an action for "restitution": you have been unfairly enriched by the doctor, and must "disgorge" the unfair enrichment.On the other hand, if you had started smashing on of Mike's Maseratis with a sledge hammer, Mike would under traditional common law be within his rights to restrain and arrest you for vandalism on his property. See also Semayne's Case for the implied franchise that pertains to one's house to protect it from trespass. While (in the same move away from traditional English law that gave us the doctrine of substantive sovereign jurisdiction in place of property-based jurisdiction) many jurisdictions have restricted rights to defend oneself and one's property, many other jurisdictions retain them in statute, such as the "stand your ground" statutes that give you the right to protect your property as well as yourself in your house, and in some state in your automobile and at your place of business. Similarly, if while in California you started beating your spouse, there would be no traditional common law objections to California dealing with you in defense of its resident. Committing a tort (or crime) is itself implied consent to tort (or criminal) jurisdiction.The liberal justices with their pseudo-contractual or pseudo-restitutionary talk of "availment" to "significant benefit" giving rise to arbitrary jurisdiction do not explain why California's assertion of jurisdiction over out-of-state marriage and property is not also simply officious intermeddling. They certainly do not explain why, even if you've unfairly enriched yourself by driving free on California's roads, you should be forced to disgorge far more than the value you obtained, and in areas of your life unrelated to highway safety: your marriage, property, and children.Assertion of sovereign jurisdiction, the kind were taught in school is the only kind, is in fact the kind of jurisdiction that is the most unjust and that is on most intellectually shaky ground. U.S. courts either simply don't try to justify it or try to justify it with absurd pseudo-contractual arguments. Like their intellectual forebears with their specious idea of a "social contract," many modern justices at least recognize the moral requirement for consent to jurisdiction. But they too fail to address the issue with intellectual seriousness, because the consequences for the law of jurisdiction would be too radical: their own courts could lose most of their power.There are some good arguments for some sovereign jurisdiction, but they lead to a sovereignty far smaller than that exercised by the modern state. The necessity for some minimal sovereign court, to which you and I are bound "just because," seems unavoidable. For both the property- and contract-based jurisdictions there seems to be the need for at least a "night watchman" or "meta" court that determines the questions of basic jurisdiction itself. In property-based jurisdictions such as the franchises of England, the king's courts determined these questions as a matter of "trespass" on (infringement of) franchise property. It was also possible for a court to trespass on a defendant by violating basic due process rights associated with the type of jurisdiction, for example torturing the defendant or by denying right to a trial by jury. In a contract-based system, involuntary courts with large territories would be needed to determine, if disputed, the preliminary question of whether a proper contract had been formed with a proper choice of forum clause. In the U.S. this question is answered by the court with jurisdiction over the contract, usually a court of the state where the contract was formed.

Imagine if the only place you could refill your gas tank was at home, so that you could never choose to drive farther than one tankful of gas would carry you.   Furthermore, imagine that it usually required most of a tankful to get from one place you want to go to another -- or to get back home.  So you usually could choose to go only one place per trip, and even when you could go more than one place, you had to plan the entire trip well ahead of time and could not deviate from it, no matter how much your needs changed while on the trip.That is largely the situation with space operations today.  You have to plan the entire mission ahead of time.   If in mid-mission you discover that you want to change the plane of your orbit, or extend the life of your satellite, or make any other change that requires more propellant than you long ago planned for, you are out of luck.   If you want to reserve a wide variety of such decisions instead of committing to the entire plan up-front, it won't happen unless you launch a great deal of extra propellant that you will probably never use.Refueling capabilities and orbital propellant depots can change that.   They provide choices -- what economists call real options.  Like financial options, in an uncertain world real options often have substantial value.  The kinds of real options commonly encountered in the business world include input mix options (options to use different inputs to deliver the substantially same output), output mix options (to use the same inputs to deliver different outputs), termination options (to abandon early failing projects or projects that have become unimportant), intensity or scale options (options to increase or decrease output), options to stop and restart, and switching options (the option to abandon one mean or end and change to another).  All of these options can have a substantial operational and financial value that is not captured by traditional analysis of fixed plans.Propellant depots don't provide substantially cheaper propellant: it must all, for the near future, still be launched quite expensively from earth.  And propellant depots don't provide an infinite variety of choices.  They won't make it affordable for astronauts headed for Mars to return back home when they discover that they forgot to pack their toothbrushes.  Orbital mechanics is relentless and an option to take on extra, but still expensive, propellant can only change things so much, and you especially won't be able to afford such an option if you're off the beaten path.   But propellant depots and refuelable satellites will allow those operating satellites in common orbits, such as geosynchronous orbit and low polar earth orbit, to change plans during a satellite's lifetime by adding a wide variety of valuable real options, for example:* Spy satellites have highly uncertain propellant usage, and often end their lifetimes mostly full of propellant or exhaust their propellant long before any other components have degraded.  Propellant depots will give spy satellites real options to optimize time over certain targets, to avoid a variety of attacks by changing orbits, and add flexibility to respond to other unpredictable challenges.* Commercial satellites: depots will extend the lifetimes of satellites that prove to be important, and allow satellites to be relocated over new locations as markets change. (With a few extra features on a depot tanker, propellant already on board a broken satellite, or a satellite that has proved to be unimportant, might be "siphoned" back into the tanker and used on a working and important spacecraft).* Upper stages and satellites can be checked out to make sure they are in working order on orbit before being fueled.   Immediate systems failure, which is a common failure mode, need no longer result in the waste of expensive propellant.  This short list is probably the tip of the iceberg.   Real options are about the unpredictable, and it's hard to make a list of the unpredictable ahead of time.  On-orbit refueling and orbital propellant depots are not just a technology, they are part of a new paradigm.  They are part of thinking of space activities in terms of real options instead of fixed plans.  This paradigm recognizes uncertainties in space missions and businesses that traditonal fixed space planning has neglected.   Making good use of propellant depots requires not only technology, but the recognition of these uncertainties, and as a result a recognition of the  options that businessmen, militaries, and scientists would like to retain.   Those options can then be brought to reality with refuelable satellites and orbital depots, quite possibly in association with other technologies that enhance mission flexibility in other ways.  It's not propellant depots and refueling capabilities by themselves that will be beneficial, it will be their use to enable a wide variety of new and valuable real options for spacecraft operators and users.   It will be a crucial and lucrative entrepreneurial task to identify these real options and enable them with refuelable satellites, depots, and probably a wide variety of other techniques and services.Going back to our humble earthbound example, real options explain why most commuters prefer cars (with gas stations available in a wide variety of locations) to mass transist.  Mass transist resembles far more the fixed plan -- travel from home to work and back every day, and that's it.   Under the fixed-plan assumption, mass transit is far less expensive and far more energy-efficient than automobiles.  Cars, and the gas stations that refuel them, provide real options -- to pick up kids from baseball today, to go to a class after work tommorrow, to go shopping at one of a wide variety of stores, to visit your doctor or the emergency room when you get sick, to pick up your friend from the airport after work the next day, and so on.   Mass transit and traditional space mission planning both represent the mentality of artificial certainty, the idea that we can simply plot out the future and it will come to fruition just so.  At least space mission planners have the excuse of orbital mechanics, which is highly predictable.   Human beings are not, nor are the vast variety of our needs and desires known to planners.  Economic comparisons between mass transit and automobiles that don't account for the vast number and variety of options made real by the the latter will grossly underestimate the value of automobiles.Related:Real options analysis also allows planning for discontinous risk, rather than the artificial assumption that risk is a continuous function that can be modeled simply by adding a risk premium to a risk-free interest rate.  More on that, and the implications for space mission evaluation, here.Here is an introduction to mathematical analysis of real options, and here is a discussion of orbital depots for propellants that turn into vapors at normal temperatures, and are thus hard to store.
Images: Copper halfpenny minted by the Darbies' Coalbrookdale Company and celebrating the Iron Bridge.Here's an interesting letter from the dawn of the industrial revolution. It was written in 1775 by Abiah Darby, mother of Abraham Darby (III) and wife of Abraham Darby (II), the son of Abraham Darby (I), who invented the process of smelting iron with coke made from coal. The Darby family were Quakers and produced several early industrialists and engineers. This small letter makes or implies several points that may have been crucial to the growth of industry that makes modern wealth possible:* The importance of property rights and market prices in maintaining a sustainable balance between the supply and demand of wood. ("woods for charcoal became very Scarce and landed Gentlemen rose the prices of cord wood exceeding high"). Although wood became expensive, there remained a sufficient supply of wood for the buildings, mine works, wagons, rails, etc.* The ability of people living with sufficient technology and secure property rights to bypass and surpass ecological limitations (in this case substituting coal for wood, and later due to this cheap iron-making process, iron and steel for wood).* Decentralized money issue. Abiah points out that the remote area of Coalbrookdale, where coal and iron were available, still often operated as a barter economy. Thus apparently Abraham had to either coin tokens or open a bank to issue notes (common during this era) so that the Darbies could pay their workers.* Darby II's invention of the iron-tracked railroad (improving the productivity of the horses by over six times and precursor to the later steam-powered railroad).* The ability to securely establish large machine works and lay 20 miles of track out in the boondocks and not have them be torn up by trespassers and used for other purposes or confiscated or taxed into oblivion by local lords. In most of the rest of the world that could not be taken for granted.* The use of atmospheric pressure (Papin/Savery/Newcomen) steam engines to drain the mines and supply water to the waterwheel pond. (The atmospheric engine apparently wasn't up to the job of directly powering the bellows for the blast furnaces; that came later with the Watt steam pressure engine). Steam engines allowed water to be pumped out of mines at a far greater rate, and thus allowed coal and iron mines to be dug far deeper, creating a large and inexpensive new supply of coal and iron.The link is a Word document, which I don't recommend opening for security reasons, but I've copied the contents below:http://www.umassd.edu/ir/Resources/MetalandMining/m2.docMrs. Abiah Darby on developments in the Darby ironworks at Coalbrookdale, 1708-1763Esteemed Friend,Thy very acceptable favour of the 9th ulto. claim'd my earliest acknowledgments, which I should immediately have made, had not thy kind condescension in taking notice of my late honour'd Husband, and requesting to be inform'd of any circumstance which may be interesting relating him, caused my delay-to recollect what might occur concerning his transactions or improvements in the Manufactory of Iron, so beneficial to this nation. But before I proceed further, I cannot help lamenting with thee in thy just observation, " that it has been universally observed, that the Destroyers of mankind are recorded and remembered, while the Benefactors are unnoticed and forgotten". This seems owing to the depravity of the mind, which centres in reaping the present advantages, and suffering obscurity to vail the original causes of such benefits; and even the very names of those to whom we are indebted for the important discoveries, to sink into oblivion. Whereas if they were handed down to posterity, gratitude would naturally arise in the commemoration of their ingenuity, and the great advantages injoyed from their indefatigable labours-I now make free to communicate what I have heard my Husband say, and what arises from my own knowledge; also what I am inform'd from a person now living, whose father came here as a workman at the first beginning of these Pit Coal Works.Then to begin at the original. It was my Husband's Father, whose name he bore (Abraham Darby and who was the first that set on foot the Brass Works at or near Bristol) that attempted to mould and cast Iron pots, &c., in sand instead of Loam (as they were wont to do, which made it a tedious and more expensive process) in which he succeeded. This first attempt was tryed at an Air Furnace in Bristol. About the year 1709 he came into Shropshire to Coalbrookdale, and with other partners took a lease of the works, which only consisted of an old Blast Furnace and some Forges. He here cast Iron Goods in sand out of the Blast Furnace that blow'd with wood charcoal; for it was not yet thought of to blow with Pit Coal. Sometime after he suggested the thought, that it might be practable to smelt the Iron from the ore in the blast Furnace with Pit Coal: Upon this he first try'd with raw coal as it came out of the Mines, but it did not answer. He not discouraged, had the coal coak'd into Cynder, as is done for drying Malt, and it then succeeded to his satisfaction. But he found that only one sort of pit Coal would suit best for the purpose of making good Iron. -These were beneficial discoveries, for the moulding and casting in sand instead of Loam was of great service, both in respect to expence and expedition. And if we may compare little things with great-as the invention of printing was to writing, so was the moulding and casting in Sand to that of Loam. He then erected another Blast Furnace, and enlarged the Works. This discovery soon got abroad and became of great utility.This Place and its environs was very barren, little money stiring amongst the Inhabitants. So that I have heard they were Obliged to exchange their small produce one to another instead of money, until he came and got the Works to bear, and made Money Circulate amongst the different parties who were employed by him. Yet notwithstanding the Service he was of to the Country, he had opposers and ill-wishers, and a remarkable circumstance of awful Memory occurs; of a person who endeavour'd to hinder the horses which carried the Iron Stone and Coal to the Furnaces, from coming through a road that he pretended had a right to Oppose: and one time when he saw the horses going alone, he in his Passion, wished he might Never Speak More if they should Ever come that way again. And instantly his Speech was stopped, and altho' he lived Several years after yet he Never Spoke More!  My Husband's Father died early in life; a religious good man, and an Eminent Minister amongst the people call'd Quakers.My Husband Abraham Darby was but Six years old when his Father died-but he inherited his genius-enlarg'd upon his plan, and made many improvements. One of Consequence to the prosperity of these Works was as they [were] very short of water that in the Summer or dry Seasons they were obliged to blow very slow, and generally blow out the furnaces once a year, which was attended with great loss. But my Husband proposed the Erecting a Fire Engine to draw up the Water from the lower Works and convey it back into the upper po6ls, that by continual rotation of the Water the furnaces might be plentifully supplied; which answered Exceeding Well to these Works, and others have followed the Example.But all this time the making of Barr Iron at Forges from Pit Coal pigs was not thought of. About 26 years ago my Husband conceived this happy thought-tbat it might be possible to make bar from pit coal pigs. Upon this he Sent some of our pigs to be tryed at the Forges, and that no prejudice might arise against them he did not discover from whence they came, or of what quality they were. And a good account being given of their working, he errected Blast Furnaces for Pig Iron for Forges. Edward Knight Esqr a capitol Iron Master urged my Husband to get a patent, that he might reap the benefit for years of this happy discovery: but he said he would not deprive the public of Such an Acquisition which he was Satisfyed it would be; and so it has proved, for it soon spread, and Many Furnaces both in this Neighbourhood and Several other places have been errected for this purpose.Had not these discoveries been made the Iron trade of our own produce would have dwindled away, for woods for charcoal became very Scarce and landed Gentlemen rose the prices of cord wood exceeding high-indeed it would not have been to be got. But from pit coal being introduced in its stead the demand for wood charcoal is much lessen'd, and in a few years I apprehend will set the use of that article aside.Many other improvements he was the author of. One of Service to these Works here they used to carry all their mine and coal upon horses' backs but he got roads made and laid with Sleepers and rails as they have them in the North of England for carring them to the Rivers, and brings them to the Furnaces in Waggons. And one waggon with three horses will bring as much as twenty horses used to bring on horses' backs. But this laying the roads with wood begot a Scarcity and rose the price of it. So that of late years the laying of the rails of cast Iron was substituted; which altho' expensive, answers well for Ware and Duration. We have in the different Works near twenty miles of this road which cost upwards of Eight hundred pounds a mile. That of Iron Wheels and axletrees for these waggons was I believe my Husband's Invention.He kept himself confined to the Iron Trade and the Necessary Appendages annex'd thereto. He was just in Ms dealings-of universal benevolence and charity, living Strictly to the Rectitude of the Divine and Moral Law, held forth by his great Lord and Saviour, had an extraordinary command over his own spirit, which thro' the Assistance of Divine Grace enabled to bear up with fortitude above all opposition: for it may seem very strange, so valuable a man should have Antagonists, yet he had. Those called Gentlemen with an Envious Spirit could not bear to see him prosper; and others covetious; strove to make every advantage by raising their Rents of their collieries and lands in which he wanted to make roads; and endeavour'd to stop the works. But he surmounted all: and died in Peace beloved and Lamented by many.
Marshall McLuhan, Elizabeth Eisenstein and others have described the importance of the "printing revolution" to European developments such the Reformation, Renaissance, and science. According to Eisenstein, printing finally foiled the entropy that had destroyed the vast majority of written works since ancient times. Printing also enlarged the bookshelves of scholars all over Europe: by a factor of fifty or more by the middle of the 16th century.I'd go even farther than Eisenstein. Printing soon brought literacy to vast numbers of people (eventually to the vast majority of us). Printing, especially printing in newly standardized vernaculars, changed the very consciousness of people, and turned a small corner of the world, Western Europe, into a culture that in many ways conquered the world. Widespread decentralized printing and the accompanying book markets, new schools, and rise of literacy gave rise to a new form of consciousness -- book consciousness.Colombus was among the first generation of navigators who had been reading avidly and widely since a child. On his bookshelf was Marco Polo's Travels. On his voyages he carried maps made by geographers who had been literate sincethey were children, and he carried astronomical tables that had been printed widely across Europe. These tables had been made by a Hungarian-Italian mathematician whose bookshelf was full of ancient Greek science and mathematics. Such information had been rather inferior and far less available just a few decades before.With the easy conquest by tiny Portugal of Asia's vast and ancient sea trade routes, rapidly literizing Western Europeans were by the early 16th century demonstrating a vast superiority in naval affairs. In navigation as in battle officers using accurate charts and astronomical tables were at a premium. (Europeans did not have quite such good luck on land against the Turks). Western Europeans would retain completely uncontested (except among each other) naval superiority on the world's oceans until the Japanese victory over Russia in the early 20th century. The Japanse by then had long since taken up printing and had a very well read population . Even on the ground by the 18th century English merchants, officers, and civil servants, practically all of them literate and widely read since young children, were finding it quite easy to conquer and take over the administration in far larger and otherwise highly advanced civilizations like India.Soon after the spread of the printing press, the very fundamentals of organization in Western Europe began to change. In the late Middle Ages organizations, even royal and papal bureaucracies and banking "super-companies", rarely engaged more than a few dozen employees. Organizational size came up against the severe limit of the Dunbar number. By the end ofthe 16th century, the colonial companies and bureaucracies of Spain and Portugal were vast, highly literate, and well coordinated. Officer corps had often been raised on military books and thus able to draw lessons from a wide variety of ancient and recent battles. Even a minor salt extractor in Wear, England, was employing 300 men by the mid 16th century. (Large organizations in manufacturing would largely have to wait until the 18th century and the industrial revolution, however).Before book consciousness there had been no national languages, but only a range of often mutually incomprehensible dialects and in Western Europe the language of the tiny literate elite, Latin. With newly unified national vernaculars, organizations were able to coordinate and grow in an unprecedented manner. A much larger group of people, raised on the same written language, increasingly also came to look and speak similarlyand become far more mutually trusted. It was the birth of national loyalty and nationwide webs of trust. The "tribe" to which we are instinctively loyal vastly increased in size. The pool of already somewhat trusted "same tribe" people from which a bureacracy could recruit new members vastly increased. National polities and militaries were able to coordinate political, economic, and battlefield strategies in an unprecedentedmanner. The 16th century saw the first major growth of the joint-stock corporation, enabling far more capital to be invested in the enlarging organizations that engaged in mining and manufacture as well as government and conquest. This development is probably a response to the new ability to form larger organizations, since the basic ideas (corporate law, shares of stock, etc.) had already been in use in Europe for quite some time. Some of the early English 16th century joint-stock companies included military expeditions (Drake's privateering voyages and naval actions were financed through joint stock companies: a different company for each expedition), trading and slaving companies (the Muscovy and Guniea companies) and mining and manufacturing companies (the Royal Mining Company and the Royal Batteries & Mines Company). The most famous became the English East India Company, but many of the American colonies were also joint-stock corporations. The first widely traded and initially most successful joint-stock company was the Dutch East India company,which quickly grew far beyond the Dunbar number to have thousands of employees.Book consciousness changed almost every profession. Good books on a trade could greatly increase the knowledge imparted during apprenticeships, and indeed eventually led to the end of the apprecenticeship system. Meanwhile, widely printed books on mathematics and science, such as Euclid's Geometry, gave knowledge that could be used in a wide variety of occupations, and training was often restructured to assume and build upon such new general knowledge.    This led to a profound change in labor productivity, moving mankind away from the Malthusian curve and (along with the expansion of organizational size beyond the Dunbar limit) eventually to the industrial revolution.A typical example of the rise of book consciousness was the radical improvement in how cases were reported in the English legal system by the late 16th century. For the first time, cases and statutes were widely and accurately cited. This reflected the fact that judges, barristers, attorneys, and even some of the parties had for the first time printed books of statutes and cases at their fingertips -- instead of having to find the single copy of a scroll hidden away in some monk's or bureacrat's library. The first great English opinion writer, Sir Edward Coke, dates from this period. In turn, the wide availability of printed statute and case law led to basic changes in the way we interpret and view the law.Almost invariably, during the colonial period, when largely illiterate cultures (i.e. cultures where mostof the second-tier nobility, military officers, and merchants, and almostall craftsmen and farmers, had not been raised on books) were encountered by literate Europeans, the latter described the former with severe ephithats, suchas "savages." This makes our forbears seem odious to us, who understand that all human races are capable of literacy, and indeed by now book consciousness has spread to most of the globe and most of us encounter a widevariety of highly literate people every day. However, at least in the 16th century for book-raised Western Europeans this was not so much a racialprejudice as a largely accurate observation. "Savage" was applied not only to neolithic Africans and Americans, but also to Irish backlanders and Scottish highlanders. There was a similar Western European attitude to otherwise very advanced civilizations in India and China. From the 16th century onward, any culture that did not have book consciousness was a culture of savages.It's possible that today the availability of thousands of times still more material to read, readily accessible by search engine, and the expansion of a small number language groups (but especially English) to a worldwide real-time network is creating a new "Internet consciousness." People within this network may soon come to see people outside of it as savages. But that is a topic for another post.
The D.C. Circuit has held that Congress cannot delegate lawmaking power to an international organization. The case is a lawsuit brought by an environmental group against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for an alleged violation of the Montreal Protocol. The group argued that the EPA violated "decisions," or agreements that have been negotiated by party countries since ratification of the Protocol, defining "critical uses" which would be exempt from the general ban on the ozone-eating chemical methyl bromide. Some choice quotes: If the “decisions” [further agreements made after the treaty was ratified] are “law” – enforceable in federal court like statutes or legislative rules – then Congress either has delegated lawmaking authority to an international body or authorized amendments to a treaty without presidential signature or Senate ratification, in violation of Article II of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has not determined whether decisions of an international body created by treaty are judicially enforceable. But there is a close analogy in this court...we held that rulings of the [International Court of Justice] do not provide “substantive legal standards for reviewing agency actions,” because the rulings, though authorized by the ratified treaty, were not themselves self-executing treaties. [citations elided]....A holding that the Parties’ postratification side agreements were “law” would raise serious constitutional questions in light of the nondelegation doctrine, numerous constitutional procedural requirements for making law, and the separation of powers...To illustrate, suppose the President signed and the Senate ratified a treaty with Germany and France to conserve fossil fuel. How this is to be accomplished the treaty does not specify. In a later meeting of representatives of the signatory countries at the United Nations, a consensus is reached to lower the speed limits on all major highways of the signatory nations to a maximum of 45 miles per hour. No one would say that United States law has thus been made.The court makes an interesting distinction between using an international organization's "decisions" to interpret ratified (and thus binding) treaty language and enforcing them as law itself: Like any interpretive tool ... the “decisions” are useful only to the extent they shed light on ambiguous terms in the Protocol. But the details of the critical-use exemption are not ambiguous. They are nonexistent. The “decisions” do not interpret treaty language. They fill in treaty gaps.The court then makes a good analogy from contract law to treaty law: Article 2H(5) thus constitutes an “agreement to agree.” The parties agree in the Protocol to reach an agreement concerning the types of uses for which new production and consumption will be permitted [i.e. the critical use exemption], and the amounts that will be permitted. “Agreements to agree” are usually not enforceable in contract. (“A treaty is in its nature a contract between . . . nations.”). And the fruits of those agreements are enforceable only to the extent that they themselves are contracts. There is no doubt that the “decisions” are not treaties. [citations elided]The court goes on to interpret the language of the Montreal Protocol to be consistent with the non-delegation doctrine, and thus as not authorizing courts to enforce post-ratification "consensus agreements": they "are international political commitments rather than judicially enforceable domestic law."This is a great decision, not because it preserves "sovereignty," but because it recognizes that a strong non-delegation doctrine is crucial to allocating Constitutional powers where the Framers intended them to be allocated.For more on the non-delegation doctrine, see my paper origins of the non-delegation doctrine.

James Hamilton (link below) commits an egregious, but all too common, error:Yet another example, and the one people often think of first, would be if there is a higher inflation rate in the U.S. than Europe. In that case we might expect to see an increase in the price of oil that exactly equals (in percentage terms) the decrease in the value of the dollar...The graph below plots the cumulative logarithmic change since 1999 in the dollar price of one euro along with the dollar price of one barrel of oil...Hamilton then computes correlation coefficients between dollar oil prices and the euro/dollar exchange rate, finds a number of periods in which they are not closely correlated, and concludes that the dollar does not explain most of the dramatic rise in oil prices.  Why do we keep seeing this kind of reasoning from supposed authorities like Mr. Hamilton? The flaw should be quite obvious, but since I've seen it mindlessly and repeatedly perpetrated by a number of professors of economics over the last few months, allow me to tediously correct it: if greater inflation is expected in both the euro and the dollar, the price of oil will increase in both euros and dollars. The euro/dollar exchange rate reflects relative monetary changes between the dollar and the euro, and the monetary component of the dollar oil price reflects absolute monetary changes in the dollar. It is absurdly illogical to expect the relative and the absolute to be strongly correlated. If the monetary changes in the euro and the dollar are of similar magnitude and direction, oil and gold prices will go up or down for these monetary reasons while the exchange rate changes little for these reasons. If European and U.S. monetary authorities are reacting in similar ways to, for example, similar credit crunches, there is no reason to expect a substantial correlation between euro/dollar exchange rates and oil prices. We will see such correlation for monetary reasons only when they are reacting with substantially different magnitudes or in different directions.In expectation terms, the euro/dollar exchange rate reflects relative inflation expectations and surprise relative inflation between the dollar and the euro, whereas the monetary component of the dollar oil price reflects absolute inflation expectations and surprise absolute inflation for the dollar.Analyzing the weekly price quotes since 2000, I get a correlation coefficient of 0.93 between the dollar price of gold and the dollar price of oil -- both absolute measures of dollar inflation expectations and surprise dollar inflation. The alternative hypotheses, changes in expectations and surprises in technological/geological supply or industrial demand, have very different effects on gold and oil that should lead to low correlations between their prices. The high correlation between gold and oil implies that oil as well as gold price changes are dominated by monetary factors. Many professional economists seem to be in denial about these basics of life under fiat currencies, perhaps since this ruins using the highly visible gas prices for simple chapter 1 lessons about how the fundamentals of consumption demand and supply by themselves are supposed to fully determine prices. These chapter 1 exercises, besides neglecting expectations, assume fixed-value currencies, and spectacularly fail for mineral commodities in our world of fiat currencies. In that world there is a monetary component to mineral commodity prices exponential in size to the expected inflation rate. This monetary component always dominates the gold price and at more than minimal levels of expected inflation (i.e. > ~2%/year) it also dominates oil prices, as demonstrated by the high correlation between gold and oil prices since 2000.[UPDATE: another thing that puzzles many economists is why oil consumption has not dramatically slackened, and indeed in some areas has still risen, in response to climbing oil prices.  This demand puzzle is a problem for any theory, whether monetary or fundamental.  The answer involves demand fundamentals, but does not involve fundamentals that have changed substantially in the last decade: demand forms a fairly constant backdrop for the monetarily-driven dramatic rise in oil prices; it does not itself explain the rise. The answer to the demand puzzle is that despite all the recent political sci-fi rhetoric to the contrary, oil is a superior form of energy, often with no economical ready substitutes, as well as a great chemical feedstock. Automobiles in particular give us quite valuable real options that the vast majority of us actively seek and are extremely reluctant to give up. When gas prices go up we cut back on luxuries and many other kinds of necessities to make room for greater gas expenditures. Alternatives are typically costly status items, like hybrids, that are not practical substitutes for most people. As a result the demand for oil is far less elastic than for most commodities. Furthermore, because the dramatic oil price rise of the last decade is largely a monetary not a fundamental effect, the costs of alternative energies and conservation are also inflating -- they are simply much stickier than oil prices and will thus lag but eventually catch up to them. Investments in them will turn out far worse than a mere fundamental analysis would indicate, and enough people remember the 1970s, and how tacky and dangerous the small cars everybody bought in the late 1970s and early 1980s seemed by the late 1980s, that this has made people more reluctant to buy small or alternative in the current runup. Adding to oil's inelasticity are the many countries that subsidize fuel consumption.Observe that this inelasticity and these subsidies, while important for explaining the demand puzzle, have not changed substantially as dollar oil prices have climbed by more than a factor of 10 since 1998. The component of the demand curve reflecting fundamentals has gradually risen, but it has also risen by a similar proportion in many prior decades and can't explain any dramatic increase in oil prices. What has changed are inflation expectations, driven by increasing government deficits and expected central bank behavior in response to the credit crunch, among other monetary factors. Our higher oil and gold prices reflect, exponentially, the increase in these expectations.](Here's the link to Hamilton's erroneous analysis, H/T Marginal Revolution, and my comments above were originally made at that blog, and appear here slightly edited).Here are two graphs I've recently made based on my historical studies of the relationships between inflation, long-term inflation expectations, gold, and oil (click to enlarge):The first graph shows implied expected inflation based on historical weekly gold and oil prices, 2000-2008.   The oil and gold prices are adjusted for an estimate of historical inflation (specifically inflation as measured by CPU-I up to the date of the price, as opposed to inflation expected after the date of the price, which these adjusted prices imply) and for a small fundamental long-term trend (see below). The absolute expected inflation is based on certain baseline assumptions, whereas the relative changes in inflation expectations are not based on these parameters but simply on the theory that the oil and gold prices reflect the net present value of expected inflation, which is an exponential function.  There is a close correlation, specifically 0.93, between the weekly movements of gold and oil prices in this period.  The expectations implied by oil include both monetary component reflected by this correlation as well as a much smaller component primarily reflecting differing expectations and surprises between gold and oil in industrial demand and technologicaly/geological supply.  The separate oil (in gold prices) expectation graph reflects this difference. My attribution of all the differences between gold and oil to these fundamentals assumes that there has been insignificant change in the relative demand for gold and oil as money, which may be dubious assumption give the great recent rise in the use of oil and other commodity derivatives to hedge inflation in investment portfolios, and also the possibility that the security of economic property rights (i.e. effective long-term control by the same entity) in oil has increased recently faster than that of gold.   But the fundamental contribution to the price of oil in terms of gold must be substantial since the graph of the difference in price expectations between the two reflects major events impacting oil demand such as 9/11(which along with the recession from the dot-com crash greatly impacted world and especially U.S. travel, reducing oil demand).  A few potentially important monetary events, such as the appointment of Ben Bernanke to replace Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman, are also labeled.  There is a significant increase in the both the level and volatility of inflation expectations around and after this appointment as the market tried to predict how inflationary Fed policy under Bernanke might become, and generally indicated that higher inflation could be expected from Bernanke than Greenspan.   Even before Bernanke was chosen, the ballooning federal deficits after 9/11 caused a gradual but substantial increase in inflation expectations from then until the end of Greenspan's term.  Over his entire leadership from 1987 to 2006, Greenspan lowered inflation expectations from about 4% to below 2%, and they then rose to about 2 1/2% by the end of Greenspan's term, and are back above 4% today.  (Greenspan in his own book, The Age of Turbulence, published in 2007, says that with fiat currencies we can expect inflation of about 4.5% from here on out, a more pessimistic estimate than that probably implied by gold prices in 2007, but perhaps a bit more prescient than the market given that inflation expectations have increased to above 4% in 2008. Of course, remember that my model reflects changes in inflation expectations much better than absolute inflation expectations, so these absolute numbers are very approximate).Not shown on these graphs is a very interesting possible difference of nearly 1% between inflation expectations implied by gold, recently a bit over 4%, and expectations implied by TIPS (U.S. Treasury bonds with returns adjusted by the U.S. CPU-I inflation index), recently 3.3%  The difference may largely reflect the errors I have suggested might exist in my absolute (but not relative) numbers due to my choices of parameters, but they might also reflect one or more of the following:(1) The difference between the consumption basket of the U.S. urban consumer (as reflected in the CPU-I) and a global consumption basket;(2) Understatement of actual subjectively experienced inflation by the CPU-I formual based on errors in its formula, perhaps including the "hedonic" and other adjustments made to it in recent years (we don't have TIPS prices to measure differences in gold- and TIPS-implied inflation prior to 2005);(3) subtleties involving discount rate and utility curve differences between the U.S. urban consumer and some global average; and/or(4) Prices on the 10-year TIPS reflect inflation expectations only over the next 10 years, whereas gold reflects inflation expectations over an indefinetely long period.    If some event (e.g. the baby boomers reaching years of requiring peak medical attention, causing U.S. government deficits to skyrocket) posing great inflation risks is expected to occur within a foreseeable period of time but not within the next 10 years, this could be reflected in a spread between the two implied expectations.There is also a small component of long-term relative oil/gold fundamentals in my analysis.  Since the 1950s, oil prices have increased on average 0.9%/year faster than gold, which I have attributed to a fundamental difference between the two: a greater proportion of oil is actually consumed every year than gold, and so oil is gradually (i.e. at 0.9%/year) becoming scarcer relative to demand than gold.  The graphs and implied inflations are adjusted for this effect.  This is as close the numbers attribute any reality to "peak oil" theories: they show that we do not face an imminent demise of the oil economy, only a very long and very gradual increase in the technological/geological scarcity relative to consumption demand for oil.  Extrapolating the same rate as the last 50 years, the price of oil in terms of gold will take 80 years to double.  Taking out monetary factors and this gradual effect, we have had in the recent years (indeed since 1999, although until about 2003 this was masked by low inflation expectations) a small acute crisis in the fundamentals of oil, rising a bit above the 0.9%/year trend as it did in the 1970s, but this burp not substantially greater than in many former years such as in the 1970s, and I expect it, as occured in the 1980s, to reverse from technological substitutes for and conservation of oil which we are currently (as in the late 1970s and early 1980s) overinvesting in, due to monetary effects on oil prices being mistaken for fundamental ones.   This mistake will reify as alternative energies and conservation techniques (barring unexpected technological breakthroughs), with stickier prices lagging those of oil in reflecting inflation expectations, increase in price faster than oil in the next decade (assuming no further monetary problems that further increase inflation expectations and thus oil prices).  Prices besides oil, gold, and to a lesser extend other mineral commodities are far stickier than those mineral prices. Once inflation expectations increase, it takes many years for other prices (and especially the stickiest prices of all, wages) to catch up to oil and gold: these other prices greatly lag both increases and decreases in oil and gold prices, and indeed may never catch up at all if the expectations turn out to be wrong (as they indeed often are, given how little information the market actually has on future U.S. government and Fed behavior!)The second graph shows this expected versus the actual (or at least CPI-U) dollar inflation from 1968 to today.   Again from the difference between oil and gold we can see some oil fundamentals such as the impact of the Asian/Russian crisis on lowering oil prices (in terms of gold as well as, in this case, dollars, as inflation expectations were also at their lowest) in 1998 and of the Iran/Iraq war which depressed oil prices in terms of gold in the 1980s (probably due to decreased security of long-term economic property rights in their oil and the need by these oil states to fund their war with limited ability to borrow).Since I generated these graphs three weeks ago, there has been a substantial and as usual correlated drop in both dollar gold and oil prices, probably reflecting an easing of the  credit crunch in the U.S. and more confidence that the Fed, seeing its inflationary behavior lead to immediate and politically consequential pain at the gas pump, is less likely to use high inflation to default on current U.S. debts than was thought in previous weeks.  At the same time the overt default risk for Treasuries has nearly tripled, also reflecting some new political limits on inflationary default.  By the way, in the most recent week the dollar also strengthened against the euro by a similar amount, so that the explanation for last week, but not most of the previous ones, involves a monetary improvement unique to the dollar rather than shared by the Fed and the ECB.[UPDATE: here's a third graph showing implied inflation expectations derived from monthly quotes of gold and oil in dollars going back to 1974, using some different parameters than were used for the second graph econd graph.  The two expectations have a correlation coefficient of 0.76. (I forgot to run the correlation with the parameters that generated the second graph, so I wanted to show the graph corresponding to the 0.76).  This is still a strong correlation consistent with the long-term trends in oil and gold prices each reflecting a common estimate of future inflation -- gold and oil fundamentals are very different and so cannot lead to such strong correlation. This compared to two random walks with no long-term tendency to rise, which on average have no correlation.Per the comments below, the 0.93 coefficient cited above might for statistical reasons suggest much more correlation than actually there due to the rising nature of both making the differences from the mean calculated in the coefficient consistently large and thus reducing the proportional difference in movements: a random walk that tends to rise can also have correlation coefficients in the .60's to .90's.  Indeed taking correlations of differences we get only .25, on the high end of weak positive correlations, for one-week deltas, but this rises with the weeks of difference: I've calculated up to 40 week deltas which give 0.64, a strong correlation.  This suggests that weekly fluctuations are dominated more by non-monetary factors and the monetary factors don't start to dominate until the price movements are over about 6 months: fundamental fluctuations tend to be shorter term and tend (except for the 0.9% secular trend for which I've adjusted the data) cancel each other out.   There are also as I undestand it, and I am admittedly no statistical expert, statistical reasons to expect that the 0.25 is too low in that such differencing can exagerate noise.  For the two implied inflation expectations in the third graph, which have a 0.76 correlation coefficient, the exageratedly small differences in proportion due to large distances from the mean should be greatly reduced since the series is largely flat, finishing pretty much where it started.  But all this must be subject to review by people far more knowledge in statistics than I. :-)  ]
JOHN, by the grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, to his archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justices, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his officials and loyal subjects, Greeting.KNOW THAT BEFORE GOD, for the health of our soul and those of our ancestors and heirs, to the honour of God, the exaltation of the holy Church, and the better ordering of our kingdom, at the advice of [list of various bishops, earls, etc. many of them in rebellion at the time]:(1) FIRST, THAT WE HAVE GRANTED TO GOD, and by this present charter have confirmed for us and our heirs in perpetuity, that the English Church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired. That we wish this so to be observed, appears from the fact that of our own free will, before the outbreak of the present dispute between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed by charter the freedom of the Church's elections - a right reckoned to be of the greatest necessity and importance to it - and caused this to be confirmed by Pope Innocent III. This freedom we shall observe ourselves, and desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity.So seriously did the Norman kings take the theory that they originally owned all rights in all things corporeal and incorporeal that were appurtenant to their kingdom, that they "granted" subsets of these rights to God Himself. Similarly, English kings would in this and future charters "grant" what were really recognitions of existing rights. In the case of electing bishops, however, this was a right that had recently been one during the Papal Revolution wherein the pope across Europe successfully asserted the right, previously usually practiced by kings and the more powerful feudal lords, to appoint bishops. This was the beginning of the idea of the separation of church and state. This separation however never fully took hold in England, as this part of the Magna Carta was abrogated when the English Church split from the Catholic Church during the reign of Henry VIII, and even before this time secular authorities assisted the "English Church" in punishing heresy.Compare the above clause to clause 13 (this is out of order for the purposes of comparison):(13) The city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and free customs, both by land and by water. We also will and grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall enjoy all their liberties and free customs. This similar sweeping language recognizing the enjoyment of ancient liberties and customs (but as individual rights of residents rather than as the corporate rights of cities) would later occur in many later North American colonial charters. In that context they were easements in favor or third-party beneficiaries rather than grants to the parties to the charter as here.And now to the main clause of the Great Charter:TO ALL FREE MEN OF OUR KINGDOM we have also granted, for us and our heirs for ever, all the liberties written out below, to have and to keep for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs: This is the main clause of the first Great Charter of liberties under the English legal tradition. Unless otherwise specified, every liberty granted by the Great Charter is granted to all free men in perpetuity. "Free men" roughly meant all who were tenants rather than villeins (serfs). With the ends of serfdom and slavery it came to mean all residents, although it was sometimes construed just to mean all property owners or all citizens. Many modern property deeds use this same kind of language, albeit the rights they grant are usually far less valuable.(2) If any earl, baron, or other person that holds lands directly of the Crown, for military service, shall die, and at his death his heir shall be of full age and owe a 'relief', the heir shall have his inheritance on payment of the ancient scale of 'relief'. That is to say, the heir or heirs of an earl shall pay £100 for the entire earl's barony, the heir or heirs of a knight l00s. at most for the entire knight's 'fee', and any man that owes less shall pay less, in accordance with the ancient usage of 'fees' The basic idea here is that, in exchange for being subject to military service, inheritance taxes are reduced to a small fee. Having a tenure such as fee simple held "directly of the Crown" was as close as you came to outright ownership under King John. Compared to modern zoning, except for restrictions on buying and selling you actually had far better property rights under King John with these "tenures" then we do under modern zoned "ownership." Indeed, our modern forms of land ownership are just these tenures, under the same names, e.g. fee simple, with taxes of various kinds instead of "aids" and "scotage." Arguably modern forms of ownership such as fee simple are held "directly of" our government instead of the king himself. If the Magna Carta still applies to those of us living under the English legal tradition, then arguably under this clause any of us who have ever been registered for the draft is immune to all but these minimal inheritance taxes. This might encourage the wealthy to stop bribing their way out of drafts the rest of us are subject to.(4) The guardian of the land of an heir who is under age shall take from it only reasonable revenues, customary dues, and feudal services. He shall do this without destruction or damage to men or property...This clause could come straight out of a modern law and economics textbook. The problem of "waste," wherein a temporary possessor of property loots it, is still a big problem in modern property law.   It's also a big problem for the whole country when you have a temporary dictator rather than a king who expects his heir(s) to take the throne.   By the way, the guardianship was actual alienable property -- once the king or lord granted guardianship of one of their underage tenants to somebody, that office could be bought or sold as well as devised or transferred via marriage.(12) No 'scutage' or 'aid' may be levied in our kingdom without its general consent, unless it is for the ransom of our person, to make our eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry our eldest daughter. For these purposes only a reasonable 'aid' may be levied. 'Aids' from the city of London are to be treated similarly. For political scientists interested in the origins of democracy is the most famous clause of the Magna Carta, along with(14) To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessment of an 'aid' - except in the three cases specified above - or a 'scutage', we will cause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons to be summoned individually by letter. To those who hold lands directly of us we will cause a general summons to be issued, through the sheriffs and other officials, to come together on a fixed day (of which at least forty days notice shall be given) and at a fixed place. In all letters of summons, the cause of the summons will be stated. When a summons has been issued, the business appointed for the day shall go forward in accordance with the resolution of those present, even if not all those who were summoned have appeared. In other words, for the king to collect his rents, i.e. "aid" and "scutage," he needed the consent of an assembly of his nobles (which became the House of Lords) and his other immediate tenants ("those who hold lands directly of us," which became the House of Commons). There is no representation at this point -- all the king's tenants who can take time off to come to give their "general consent" may do so (presumably by a vote, although whether majority, super-majority, or full consensus are required to obtain "general consent" is not specified).   From this tradition came the American slogan, "no taxation without representation."   Until recently there was a now neglected symmetry -- no representation without taxation.   Our legislatures originated in both principles -- that tenants of the realm had the right to collectively negotiate their rent, and that only tenants who paid rent were entitled to so negotiate.To be continued...
(Note to readers -- after several months of posting reruns, I am back to doing original posts until further notice).Arnold Kling describes his militaristic theory of the origins of money, and kindly also quotes and refers readers to my theory (or set of theories, as I posit that shell proto-money played a crucial role in several different kinds of hunter-gatherer transactions). Here is the gist of Kling's theory:Imagine that you're a warlord leading a band of soldiers. Your business model is that your soliders prey on farmers, taking plunder and tribute. To help motivate your soldiers, you promise them a share of the booty. When the band of warriors is small, the promises can be verbal and informal. However, in order to organize a large army, you need formal, written contracts. Lacking lawyers and xerox machines, you make little carvings on metal, hand them out to soldiers, and say, "After the battle, turn this in to the clerk and we'll give you a share of captured slaves and grain and stuff."There may not be as much contrast between our theories as Kling suggests. We both seem to agree that the traditional economists' explanation of money emerging from a barter market that otherwise obeyed the principles of efficient modern markets is not historically sound (although I do believe it is theoretically and empirically sound as a theory of the way things can happen -- money-like intermediate commodities can and have been observed to emerge from barter markets). Where we may differ, and perhaps not by much, is on the role of coercion. I believe that both coercive and voluntary transactions (and transactions that partook of both components) were important, and that the voluntary transactions were not efficient market exchanges:Voluntary spot trades are not the only kinds of transactions that benefit from lower transaction costs. This is the key to understanding the origin and evolution of money. Family heirlooms could be used as collateral to remove the credit risk from delayed exchanges. [As explained elswhere in the article, these were typically exchanges that involved very high transaction costs. I'd add in clarification now that the closest modern economic model of them would be bilateral monopoly, not spot exchange on an efficient market]. The ability of a victorious tribe to extract tribute from the vanquished was of great benefit to the victor . The victor's ability to collect tribute benefited from some of the same kinds of transaction cost techniques as did trade. So did the plaintiff in assessment of damages for offenses against custom or law [emphasis added], and kin groups arranging a marriage. Kin also benefited from timely and peaceful gifts of wealth by inheritance. The major human life events that modern cultures segregate from the world of trade benefited no less than trade, and sometimes more so, from techniques that lowered transaction costs. None of these techniques was more effective, important, or early than primitive money -- collectibles....Warfare involved, among other things, killing, maiming, torture, kidnapping, rape, and the extortion of tribute in exchange for avoiding such fates. When two neighbor tribes were not at war, one was usually paying tribute to the other. Tribute could also serve to bind alliances, achieving economies of scale in warfare. Mostly, it was a form of exploitation more lucrative to the victor than further violence against the defeated. Victory in war was sometimes followed by an immediate payment from the losers to the victims. Often this just took the form of looting by the enthusiastic victors, while the losers desperately hid their collectibles. More often, tribute was demanded on a regular basis. In this case, the triple coincidence could and sometimes was avoided by a sophisticated schedule of payments in kind that matched the losing tribe's ability to supply a good or service with the victor's demand for it. However, even with this solution primitive money could provide a better way -- a common medium of value that greatly simplified the terms of payment – very important in an era when terms of the treaty could not be recorded but had to be memorized. In some cases, as with the wampum as used in the Iriquois Confederacy, the collectibles doubled as a primitive mnemonic device that, while not verbatim, could be used as an aid to recall the terms of the treaty. For the winners, collectibles provided a way to collect tribute at closer to the Laffer optimum. For the losers, collectibles buried in caches provided a way to “under-report”, leading the victors to believe the losers were less wealthy and thus demand less than they might. Caches of collectibles also provided insurance against over-zealous tribute collectors. Much of the wealth in primitive societies escaped the notice of the missionaries and anthropologists due to its highly secretive nature. Only archeology can reveal the existence of this hidden wealth. Hiding and other strategies presented a problem that tribute collectors share with modern tax collectors – how to estimate the amount of wealth they can extract. Value measurement is a thorny problem in many kinds of transactions, but never more so than in the antagonistic collection of tax or tribute. In making these very difficult and nonintuitive trade-offs, and then executing them in a series of queries, audits, and collection actions, tribute collectors efficiently optimized their revenue, even if the results seemed quite wasteful to the tribute payer. Imagine a tribe collecting tribute from several neighbor tribes it previously defeated in war. It must estimate how much it can extract from each tribe. Bad estimates leave the wealth of some tribes understated, while forcing others to pay tribute based on estimates of wealth they don't actually have. The result: the tribes that are hurt tend to shrink. The tribes that benefit pay less tribute than could be extracted. In both cases, less revenue is generated for the victors than they might be able to get with better rules. This is an application of the Laffer curve to the fortunes of specific tribes. On this curve, applied to income taxes by the brilliant economist Arthur Laffer, as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate, due to increased avoidance, evasion, and most of all disincentive to engage in the taxed activity. At a certain rate due to these reasons tax revenues are optimized. Hiking the tax rate beyond the Laffer optimum results in lower rather than higher revenues for the government. We do seem to differ in that Kling's account is basically an account of the origins of coinage in the agricultural era, and mine is an account of the origins of shell proto-money in the hunter-gatherer era. As indicated above, I believe both coercion and voluntary transactions (and admixtures of same) played an important role in the hunter-gatherer era, and as a general matter that's also true of the agricultural era.I have very little disagreement with Kling's account of the importance of coercion in the origin of coinage. Indeed, here's what I had to say about the origins of coinage: Given what we have seen about the benefits of proto-money to tribute and tax collectors, as well as the critical nature of the value measurement problem in optimally coercing such payments, it is not surprising that tax collectors, specifically the kings of Lydia, were the first major issuers of coinage. The king, deriving his revenue from tax collection, had a strong incentive to measure to value of wealth held and exchanged by his subjects more accurately.  That the exchange also benefited from cheaper measurement by traders of the medium of exchange, creating something closer to efficient markets, and allowing individuals to enter into the marketplace on a larger scale for the first time, was for the king a fortuitous side effect.My account of coinage differs from Kling only in that I'm looking at the measurement problem that occurs when collecting the plunder; he is looking at the measurement problem that occurs when distributing the plunder out to the soldiers. Both are important. Indeed I have also discussed the latter before on this blog (I don't recall the origins of the idea -- I may have read it somewhere -- a bleg to my kind readers, if you know of a reference, please post it in the comments):Markets will tend to standardize on whatever the dominant transactor, the party that controls the largest plurality of cash flow, standardizes on, and in most historical societies the dominant transactions were tax collection and the payment of those taxes to soldiers.By "dominant" here I just mean constituting the plurality (the largest player), not the majority of the value of all transactions, whether coercive or voluntary or some admixture of same. Coinage made measuring the value of both plunder and the distribution of plunder more accurate: both were important in increasing the efficiency of plunder and giving rise to coinage. More efficient exchanges, resembling more spot exchanges than bilateral monopoliies, and thus a larger tax base, were a fortuitous consequence for the Lydian kings (and later for the Greeks who eventually conquered the relatively coinless Persians).The issue of coercion is also deeply implicated in the origins of agriculture itself.  After all, hunter-gatherers were expert botanists compared to the modern layman.  They were perfectly well aware that one could plant seeds (and shoots, for asexual reproduction) and have them grow, and could have easily learned the basic techniques associated with early agriculture once they had experimented with this knowledge.   Yet these expert botanists with brains the same size as ours existed for 100,000 years before the agricultural breakthrough occured.  The problem was not one of farming technique, it was one of securing this capital investment from fellow tribe members and foreign tribes.  Only once this problem in coercion and transaction costs was solved could agricultural society appear.  More here and here.
From Algorithmic Information Theory: Charles Bennett has discovered an objective measurement for sophistication. An example of sophistication is the structure of an airplane. We couldn't just throw parts together into a vat, shake them up, and hope thereby to assemble a flying airplane. A flying structure is vastly improbable; it is far outnumbered by the wide variety of non-flying structures. The same would be true if we tried to design a flying plane by throwing a bunch of part templates down on a table and making a blueprint out of the resulting overlays. On the other hand, an object can be considered superficial when it is not very difficult to recreate another object to perform its function. For example, a garbage pit can be created by a wide variety of random sequences of truckfulls of garbage; it doesn't matter much in which order the trucks come. More examples of sophistication are provided by the highly evolved structures of living things, such as wings, eyes, brains, and so on. These could not have been thrown together by chance; they must be the result of an adaptive algorithm such as Darwin's algorithm of variation and selection. If we lost the genetic code for vertebrate eyes in a mass extinction, it would take nature a vast number of animal lifetimes to re-evolve them. A sophisticated structure has a high replacement cost. Bennett calls the computational replacement cost of an object its logical depth. Loosely speaking, depth is the necessary number of steps in the causal path linking an object with its plausible origin. Formally, it is the time required by the universal Turing machine to compute an object from its compressed original description.From Objective versus Intersubjective Truth:Post-Hayek and algorithmic information theory, we recognize that information-bearing codes can be computed (and in particular, ideas evolved from the interaction of people with each other over many lifetimes), which are (a) not feasibly rederivable from first principles,(b) not feasibly and accurately refutable  (given the existence of the code to be refuted)(c) not even feasibly and accurately justifiable (given the existence of the code to justify)("Feasibility" is a measure of cost, especially the costs of computation and empircal experiment. "Not feasibly" means "cost not within the order of magnitude of being economically efficient": for example, not solvable within a single human lifetime. Usually the constraints are empirical rather than merely computational). (a) and (b) are ubiqitous among highly evolved systems of interactions among richly encoded entities (whether that information is genetic or memetic). (c) is rarer, since many of these interpersonal games are likely no more diffult than NP-complete: solutions cannot be feasibly derived from scratch, but known solutions can be verified in feasible time. However, there are many problems, especially empirical problems requiring a "medical trial" over one or more full lifetimes, that don't even meet (c): it's infeasible to create a scientifically repeatable experiment. For the same reason a scientific experiment cannot refute _any_ tradition dealing with interpersonal problems (b), because it may not have run over enough lifetimes, and we don't know which computational or empirical class the interpersonal problem solved by the tradition falls into. One can scientifically refute traditional claims of a non-interpersonal nature, e.g. "God created the world in 4004 B.C.", but one cannot accurately refute metaphorical interpretations or imperative statements which apply to interpersonal relationships. As Dawkins has observed, death is vastly more probable than life. Cultural parts randomly thrown together, or thrown together by some computationally shallow line of reasoning, most likely result in a big mess rather than well functioning relationships between people. The cultural beliefs which give rise to civilization are, like the genes which specify an organism, a highly improbable structure, surrounded in "meme space" primarily by structures which are far more dysfunctional. Most small deviations, and practically all "radical" deviations, result in the equivalent of death for the organism: a mass breakdown of civilization which can include genocide, mass poverty, starvation, plagues, and, perhaps most commonly and importantly, highly unsatisying, painful, or self-destructive individual life choices. From Hermeneutics: An Introduction to the Interpretation of Tradition: Hermeneutics derives from the Greek hermeneutika, "message analysis", or "things for interpreting": the interpretation of tradition, the messages we receive from the past... Natural law theorists are trying to do a Heideggerean deconstruction when they try to find the original meaning and intent of the documents deemed to express natural law, such as codifications of English common law, the U.S. Bill of Rights, etc. For example, the question "would the Founding Fathers have intended the 1st Amendment to cover cyberspace?" is a paradigmatic hermeneutical question...[Hans-Georg] Gadamer saw the value of his teacher [Martin] Heidegger's dynamic analysis, and put it in the service of studying living traditions, that is to say traditions with useful applications, such as the law . Gadamer discussed the classical as a broad normative concept denoting that which is the basis of a liberal eduction. He discussed his historical process of Behwahrung, cumulative preservation, that, through constantly improving itself, allows something true to come into being. In the terms of evolutionary hermeneutics, it is used and propagated because of its useful application, and its useful application constitutes its truth. Gadamer also discusses value in terms of the duration of a work's power to speak directly. 
Ed Felten redubs smart contracts, at least for the purposes of tying, "PRM" (Property Rights Management). A traditional example of tying is the razors-and-blades strategy: a company sells you a razor at a loss and recoups the profit on the blades. This marketing strategy is also popular with printers and cartridges. To prevent consumers from buying off-brand cartridges and thereby foiling the marketing strategy, some printer manufacturers have embedded a cryptographic protocol whereby the printer authenticates the cartridge as containing the private key of the manufacturer. Extrapolating from this example, Felton complains about looming restrictions on our use of everyday items if "PRM" becomes a reality. Tyler Cowen rebuts Felten's complaints with respect to tying on economic grounds, pointing out that where manufacturers have an incentive to tie, it generally increases the welfare of consumers as a whole as well as manufacturers.While I am a proponent of most kinds of smart contracts, I'm also quite sympathetic to the freedom-to-tinker movement. I generally oppose legislation like DMCA that artificially protects insecure smart contracts. And consumers should be empowered to choose their smart contracts wisely. I support open source protocols so that somebody neutral has read the smart fine print. Smart contract protocols, like legal contracts, should be in the public domain.As a commentor to Felten's post pointed out, manufacturers usually don't have contractual privity with consumers, unless you order direct. Through smart contracts, manufacturers may gain some digital privity with the end user.At least in the context of the United States legal system, it's fair for manufacturers to restrict how consumers can use their products, since, breaching privity, U.S. courts at least have already decided that manufacturers are strictly liable for unsafe products, often even when the consumers misuse them. Thus manufacturers go to great lengths to make products "idiot proof" and also, alas, "tinker proof." Since Felton wants the freedom to tinker, he should oppose strict product liability. At least, people who tinker and get hurt should not be able to sue the manufactuer.
Top constitutional scholars and former high-level U.S. government officials explain to Congress why by spying on domestic-overseas phone calls without warrants, the U.S. National Security Agency is breaking the law.  They observe the Department of Justice letter "fail[ed] to to offer a plausible defense" of the NSA's organized criminal activities.  This is quite a statement -- in the U.S. legal world, there is a plausible argument for almost any position.  It further demonstates that as I have observed the Justice Department has in a very self-serving manner misled the President and is now misleading the American people about what the law is.  Look for the Justice Department to mislead the Supreme Court on this issue in the future, as they have done with other issues of executive power in the past, even before Ashcroft and Gonzales headed that department which we are supposed to be able to trust with federal law enforcement.
Bog men dating from between 390 and 175 BC in Ireland used hair gel made out of pine resins imported from Spain or southwest France.
The U.S. government has confiscated some e-gold related funds on the pretext of failure to obtain a license as a "money transmitter," as Ian Grigg reports. Apparently e-gold has already had to put up with "approximately 300 summonses, subpoenas, and other requests for information." Unless they are counting routine stuff, that sounds rather like harassment. The feds are arguing that the U.S. portion of e-gold, G&SR, is a "money transmitter" even though the U.S. Treasury has refused to recognize e-gold as a "currency."Thanks to the out-of-control Washington D.C. bureaucracy, the U.S. is becoming a poor place to do business if you have an innovative business that rubs some people in D.C. the wrong way. For example, if you claim that you have a new form of money that competes with inflating U.S. dollars.Another thing that may rub feds the wrong way is the embarrassing fact that e-gold has appreciated by over 100% compared to the U.S. dollar since 1999. In other words, if you held $1,000 worth of e-gold since 1999, it would be worth over $2,000 now. It's closer to the truth to say that the dollar is worth about half what it was in 1999 than to say that e-gold is worth twice as much. Which currency is the funny money?Interestingly, Yahoo Finance considers gold (although not e-gold in particular) to be a "currency" for the purposes of their currency converter.
The most notorious feature of the U.S. patent system is the current test for obviousness. On top of being "novel," patents are supposed to be "non-obvious." The novelty test is relatively straightforward: nobody must have previously described a device that has all the elements of the disputed patent claim. Thus, if A+B, B, and C have already been made or described, then A+B+C and B+C are novel but A+B is not.In order to not bother people with trivial combinations, patent law has longed deemed that on top of novelty there be an "inventive step," which in the U.S. now goes under the name of "non-obviousness." To the Supreme Court in the 1950s, this meant that a patent claim must demonstrate "the extraordinary level of innovation, beyond the capabilities of a person having ordinary skill in the art, that warrants the award of a patent." This expressed most engineers' aspirations about what a true invention consists of, but it was notoriously subjective, leading to arbitrary decisions by patent examiners and courts. To create a more objective test, in the 1970's the Supreme Court held that a new combination which did not change the respective functions of at least some of the elements was obvious.Then Congress created the Federal Circuit and granted it a virtual monopoly over patent appeals. The Federal Circuit proceeded to radically change patent law in a variety of areas, usually in favor of the patent seeker or holder. Until this most recent term, the Supreme Court has largely let it do so. But now, first with eBay and now with this obviousness case (KSR v. Teleflex), the Supreme Court is starting to rein it in.Among the law the Federal Circuit changed, it made the obviousness test far more difficult for a patent examiner or alleged infringer to prove, but also made the test far more objective and straightforward. To be obvious, according to the Federal Circuit, there must be a teaching, suggestion, or motivation in prior literature that would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art (i.e. your typical engineer in the particular field) to have made the claimed combination. For the purposes of this counterfactual test it is assumed that this hypothetical engineer had all relevant prior art pasted on the walls of his office. The teaching or suggestion doesn't have to be a full-fledged description of a combination of the elements, as in novelty, but in practice the infringer almost has had to prove a lack of novelty in order to prove a lack of obviousness, rendering the obviousness test almost superfluous and leading to the raft of trivial patents engineers complain of these days.I'm proud to say that the professors of two of the best patent classes I took in law school are leading the charge to overturn the Federal Circuit's obviousness test. John Duffy is co-counsel for the petitioner, KSR, which is challenging the Federal Circuit law. Robert Brauneis is Counsel of Record for the 24 Law Professors as friends of the Court who support reforming the obviousness test. These are two very talented individuals and I predict a splendid success.KSR in its brief argues that the Supreme Court's test(s) should be restored, but it gives short shrift as to what specifically the test of obviousness should be. If you have good idea(s) for what the test(s) for obviousness should be, now is the time to let us know.Patently Obvious has more discussion of the issue and links to all the various briefs.
Besides the robot apocalypse, there are many other, and often more important, examples of Pascal scams.  The following may be or may have been such poorly evidenced but widely feared or hoped-for extreme consequences (these days the fears seem to predominate):That we are currently headed for another financial industry disaster even worse than 2008 (overwrought expectations often take the form of "much like the surprise we most recently experienced, only even more extreme").That global warming has caused or will cause disaster X (droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, ...)A whole witch's brew of "much like what just happened" fears were the many terrorist disaster fears that sprouted like the plague in the years after 9/11: suitcase nukes, the "ticking-time bomb" excuse for legalizing torture, envelopes filled with mysterious white powders, and on and on.On the positive daydream side, Eric Drexler's "molecular nanotechnology" predictions of the 1980s: self-replicating robots, assemblers that could make almost anything, etc. -- a whole new industrial revolution that would make everything cheap. (Instead, it was outsourcing and a high-tech version of t-shirt printing that made many things cheap, and "nanotechnology" became just a cool buzzword to use when talking about chemistry).A big hope of some naive young engineers during the previous high oil price era of the late 1970s: solar power satellites made from lunar materials, with O'Neill space colonies to house the workers. Indeed, a whole slew of astronaut voyages and industries in space were supposed to follow after the spectacular (and spectacularly expensive) Apollo moon landings -- a "much like recently experienced, only more so" daydream.The "Internet commerce will replace bricks-and-mortar and make all the money those companies were making" ideas that drove the Internet bubble in the late 1990s. Indeed, most or all of the bubbles and depressions in financial markets may be caused by optimistic and pessimistic Pascal fads respectively.History is replete with many, many more such manias and scares, whether among small groups of otherwise smart people, or among the vast majority of a society.  Sometimes poorly evidenced consequences do happen to occur, just in way(s) very different from expected -- for example Columbus, following the advice of well respected authorities like Strabo and Toscanelli and heading west for India -- ending up instead in America.  And sometimes a lucky penny prophecy of a wonderful or terrible but very unlikely event comes true -- although hardly any of us ever seem to learn about these sage predictions until after the event. Then they only make us believe enough in prophecy that we fall for the next scam.

LEDs are more energy efficient and last far longer than light bulbs.   But their color range has been rather limited.   A graduate student at Vanderbilt University has discovered that you can paint LEDs with quantum dots .  The color produced by the quantum dots, nanocrystals of a precise specific size, can be varied by varying the size of the crystal, but the result is usually one specific wavelength.  Michael Bowers at Vanderbilt discovered that crystals of cadmium and selenium that contain either 33 or 34 pairs of atoms are both preferentially formed (thus making mass production easy) and emit a broad-spectrum white light akin to the sun or a standard light bulb.Another interesting application of quantum dots is for more efficient thermoelectric devices, for example devices to cool our increasingly hot silicon computer chips.  Quantum dots allow a greater ratio of thermal to electrical conductivity -- that means more heat pumped while retaining control over the electric current.  Also interesting is infrared paint.  It seems to me that infrared-scale quantum dot paint might also be used for passive thermal control.
Paul Krugman (via Brad Delong) bemoans the corruption that has become commonplace here in D.C. and sees it as an effect of growing income inequality:Both history and modern experience tell us that highly unequal societies also tend to be highly corrupt. There's an arrow of causation that runs from diverging income trends to Jack Abramoff and the K Street project. George Reisman (via Chris Engelsma) has explanation for the flat wages:The last forty years or so have seen the imposition of environmental legislation and consumer product safety legislation, and numerous other government programs that serve to increase the costs of production. The great majority of people assume that the higher costs simply come out of profits and need not concern them. But the fact is that the general rate of profit in the economic system remains more or less the same, with the result that increases in costs show up as increases in prices, or as decreases in other costs, notably, wages. The real wages of the average American are stagnating in large part because the higher real wages he could have had...have instead been used to pay for the cost of environmental and safety regulations.Krugman is definitely on to something, but he's got the causation backwards. Public choice theory predicts that the rich have disproportionate lobbying clout because they have more concentrated interests. If there is a big motivation for lobbying -- namely the growing impact of federal taxes and regulations and income redistribution on all of us over the decades within which inequality has climbed -- the rich will do a disproportionate amount of that lobbying and will get an even more disproportionate benefit from it. The result is today's K Street. The generic semi-skyscrapers of K Street -- all required by law to be shorter than the Washington Monument -- are the true capital buildings of the United States, the capitals of corruption, just a few blocks away from where I'm typing this.  It's the street under which I catch the subway home. It is in those stunted skyscrapers, rather than in the symbolic domed capital you see on TV, that most of our country's laws and regulations are in fact drafted.   The wealthy -- not to be confused, as Krugman does, with those who happen to have a high income in a particular year -- have a disproportionate clout on K Street.  As a result, federal regulation disproportionately impacts the non-wealthy, including those who are not wealthy but are trying to earn enough income to become wealthy.Reisman correctly explains why real wages aren't rising: productivity is barely keeping up with the unprecedented crush of government regulations and spending over the last several decades. When we add the disproportionate lobbying ability of the rich, who can thereby direct disproportionate costs of taxes and regulations increasingly towards the middle classes and poor, the great rise in government spending and regulation explains both flat wages and growing inequality. To Reisman's observations on business regulations I'd add the similarly strong and obvious but widely ignored connection between anti-growth zoning and rising housing prices. Housing now eats up historically extraordinary fractions of household income, and that is also a result of predatory government regulation.  Not coincidentally, anti-growth zoning also benefits wealth (houses already built and owned) at the expense of income (people who have an income but not a house, who can increasingly not afford to buy a house near where the best income jobs are).Of course, another explanation for the supposed flat wages is that we don't and can't really know whether they have been flat, or rising, or falling: the measurements that go into computing inflation and "real" wages may be quite subjective and inaccurate, for a variety of reasons. But that is a post for another day.
I've written an article on my application of the principle of least authority to the interpretation of legal language. I argue that the United States Constitution, according to its original meaning, instructs judges to construe federal statutes, regulations, executive orders, and other official acts, as well as the Constitution itself, to confer the least authority consistent with their language.  This article is based on a longer paper on the origins of the non-delegation doctrine I wrote for law school.  That paper highlights a little-known debate on the non-delegation doctrine applied to the question of whether Congress could delegate the power to define postal roads.  James Madison, among others, argued that this was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive.
I'm happy to announce that my paper "Jurisdiction as Property" made the top 10 list for all time most dowloaded papers in legal history on the Social Science Research Network, the standard site for posting scholarly legal papers here in the U.S.  Alas, the number of downloads is not quite as overwhelming as this suggests -- academic interest in the crucially important area of legal history is depressingly small -- but then again they are not counting the larger number of downloads of the paper from my own web site.  Here's my brief description of the paper:In medieval and renaissance England jurisdictions were often held as property. Relationships between these jurisdictions were property relations. The basic laws of jurisdiction were trespass and title. Infringement of a jurisdiction was a trespass, and abuse of a defendant by a court could be a trespass. In addition, the king could use his writ of right to challenge title to a franchise. In determining title, a crucial idea was seisin, which for franchises generally meant proper and continual use, and for jurisdictions in particular came to mean the following of proper procedure. Defense of trespass by and seisin of a franchise court came to imply obligations of protecting individual rights and serving the public good as well as private gain. Thus the property relations between franchises played a significant role in the development of English jurisdictional and procedural law.
NASA did not invent most of the things they are popularly given credit for.
In the first two parts of this series I described undersea oil and diamond mining operations. In addition at least two startup companies, Neptune Minerals and Nautilus Minerals, are moving into mining the seafloor for metals. They're planning to dig into extinct black smokers for copper, and possibly also zinc, gold, silver, and other minerals.  David Heydon, CEO of Nauilus Minerals, says of the remarkably high quality of the ores, "we haven’t seen these types of mineral deposits since the beginning of modern mining."Nautilus and Neptune don't plan to mine live black smokers, which would be dangerous (black smokers are hot springs with temperatures well above 200 centigrade, although not boiling because at high pressure) and environmentally questionable (live black smokers team with exotic chemosynthetic life). Rather, they plan to mine the probably far greater number of extinct and lifeless black smokers that populate the oceans.autilus paydirt: Cutting of an extinct black smoker at 1,600 meters.Geologist Steven Scott, a longtime advocate of sea mining, describes the geology of seafloor massive sulfides (SMS's). "These deposits are essentially metalliferous mud formed from hot, dense brines." They form within and around black smokers, the famous deep-sea vents discovered in 1979. Black smokers deposit "sinter-like mounds and chimneys of metal sulfides, oxides, silica and sulfates. Veins, disseminations and stockworks of relatively low metal grade impregnate the underlying lavas."Curiously, we may already be mining black smokers: billion-year-old, long-extinct black smokers whose remains now lie on dry land. "The [current live black smoker] deposits have similarities to so-called volcanogenic massive sulfide ores being mined on land in Canada and elsewhere and which formed in ancient oceans as much as 2700 million years ago. Elements of potential commercial interest in both the modern and ancient deposits are copper, zinc, lead, silver, gold and barium. About 150 seafloor sites are known, most of which lie between 1500 and 3500 meters water depth."  Neptune paydirt, topside.Both Neptune and Nautilus recently performed assays of several promising extinct smokers.  Nautilus' assay was performed by two methods: a drill based on a ship (but dropped through 1600 meters of water) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that took cutting samples.  Here are at least some of the results.  Heydon observes that "with 97% of the ocean floor yet to be extensively explored, it is likely that numerous deposits remain undiscovered."Here is more from Steven Scott.Business PlansNautilus estimates that it could cost as much as $300 million to ramp up to full-scale mining.  Its plans include a $120 million specialized mining ship, the Jules Verne.  This ship is similar to the FPSO used for deep sea oil, but will separate ore from sludge and water rather than oil from water.  A large ROV, based on the trencher ROV used to lay pipes in the deep sea oil industry, but adding a large rotating drum scraper like those used in coal mining, will scrape the smokers creating sludge which will be pumped up to the Jules Verne and processed.  Since the most expensive FPSOs can cost upwards of $800 million, the $120 million is a relative bargain. Indeed, the basic mothership/ROV setup is taken straight from the deep sea oil industry FPSO/ROV methodology.Nautilus will contribute $120 million to develop undersea tools, including pumps, pipes and two subsea crawler-miners. It will also partner with a group of engineering companies with expertise in drilling and geophysics. If Jules Verne is in place by 2009, it could stay at the Papua New Guinea site until 2014, before moving on to exploit other deposits. Nautilus estimates that it will be able to mine 6000 tonnes a day from its target site.Although there are technological hurdles to be overcome, ... 'the technology already exists; it just hasn't been integrated in this way. One beauty of the sea floor model is that a floating equipment production chain is our one main investment. Once we have the chain we can easily bring it up and redeploy it to another area.'  (More on Nautilus' plans here). Nautilus' ROV with cutting arm to take samples.Like many start-ups, Nautilus has a speculative and risky business plan, but the payoff could be vast:[Nautilus] doesn't expect to reach first-scale production until 2009. There's no comparable traditional mining business model, since many of the individual deposits underwater are too small to be economically viable if they were on land. But because offshore drilling operations can move, whereas mines on land are stuck, the combined value of deposits in a wider area makes the operation worthwhile....The worth of the oil, gas and minerals in the world's oceans is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars. If Mr. Heydon's estimates are correct, deep sea mining could have the potential to supply the world's growing demand for gold, copper and silver, among other metals. The resulting revenue could be in the billions of dollars for deep sea mining companies, of which only two currently exist....Disputes over who owns what in the ocean have been a fact of global politics for decades. For reasons of security, potential resources and sometimes just pride, countries are constantly claiming control over new chunks of underwater property. As an indicator of just how rare it is to be able to mine hassle-free in the ocean, the exploration licence Papua New Guinea granted Nautilus was a world first.More here.  See also here.In forthcoming posts in this series, we will look at some of the technological, environmental, political, and legal considerations involved in this new endeavor.

The rules throughout the Sumerian “Code” of Ur-Nammu [1], c.2100–2050 BC. (about 1400 years before the invention of coinage), show us that standard weights of silver werebeing used as a unit of account and the actual medium of payment: the codespecifically requires defendants adjudged guilty to “weigh and deliver” thespecified weight of silver. Over half of the extant rules specify fine ordamage payments in silver. The single rule specifying a silver payment thatallows an alternative medium to be used calls it out as such: it specifies “heshall bring [a slave woman], if he has no slave woman, he shall instead weighand deliver 10 shekels of silver; if he has no silver, he shall give himwhatever of value he has.” (Law 24). “In Mesopotamia, theadoption of a silver standard that equated measures of barley with a set amountof silver is illustrated by a rare example of a spiral coil of silver, lengthsof which were snipped off to pay debts.” Given a standard cross-section, equallengths of wire gave equal weights of metal. Coils could be audited by snippingthem at random points inspecting the cut section. [Link]A medium for paying fines and damagesimplies that the recipient (for example the king for a fine, or the victim forcompensation) could use that medium in further useful payments – likely forinheritance, tax, religious tithe, tribute, and exchange, among othertransactions. (These transactions, and how money emerges from them, will bediscussed in future posts). Indeed, the frequency with which a an intermediategood is used as a medium for paying legal penalties may serve as a useful proxyfor how much value that good adds (i.e. how much in transaction costs itssaves) to other transactions (including but not limited to legal penalties)involved in the circulation of that good. <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝";

It is possible that this ubiquitous geographical scopereflects a shared cultural influence that is more recent than our sharedancestry in Africa (c. 70,000 BC) but prior to Columbus and Magellan. Morelikely, it reflects a common cultural and genetic heritage dating back to atleast 70,000 BC before the exit of the ancestors of today’s Austronesian andEurasian peoples from Africa. This is also suggested by the deep age andcontinuity of the shell bead tradition detailed here.Shell beads were the predominant form of compensation money in cultures thatmigrated out of the African and Eurasian core before the dawn of livestockagriculture and metallurgy, to such diverse places as Melanesia and theAmericas.

This served toconserve transaction costs in a high transaction cost culture where exchangerelationships   resembled bilateral monopoliesmore closely than they resembled spot markets. Bargaining costs were high, and indeed bargaining failure often resultedin violence and destruction rather than merely in no deal. This made focalpoints of negotiation, such as customary prices and customary compensationamounts for specific injuries, a quite valuable and ubiquitous part of mostNeolithic and earlier cultures.  Whenspecified by law, these rules setting prices were often intermingled with lawsspecifying legal penalties and used the same set of units: in the Mesopotamianand Anatolian law codes prior to coinage, most commonly weights of silver andvolumes of barley.Price  unitFrequencyWeight  of silver68Volume  of barley6Number  of sheep7Labor  or military service appurtenant to land11Other1Frequency of legally specified pricesand rents in the Old Hittite Laws [2]One can also think blood-money-type fixed damages (compensation) andfines as customary prices for injuries.

Todaythis is solved, to the extent it is, by each side predicting what damages orpunishments they expect a court to assess, and negotiating accordingly.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:Times; panose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}a:link, span.MsoHyperlink {mso-style-priority:99; color:blue; mso-themecolor:hyperlink; text-decoration:underline; text-underline:single;}a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed {mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; color:purple; mso-themecolor:followedhyperlink; text-decoration:underline; text-underline:single;}p {mso-style-priority:99; mso-margin-top-alt:auto; margin-right:0in; mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; margin-left:0in; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Times; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}-->Copper spirals and gold discs, 4th millenium BC, Austria.

In some cases a separate set of laws(for example tort laws) arose alongside the criminal law, or wasevolved from the previous compensation culture, maintaining some compensationfor victims. Subsequently law usually evolved away from monetary compensation and towards punishments for deterrence.  A chiefconcern of criminal law became estimation of deterrence value. The king hadincentives to perform punishments both as a public good and a public show. Toallow themselves and their public to assess the deterrence value of punishments,there were two major strategies:·     “Eye for an eye”-type laws, which focus on comparing the punishmentto the crime’s injury (often similar to the injury to maximize perceivedfairness, but sometimes also more severe than the injury for extra deterrencevalue). In some of the non-silver compensation rules in the Mesopotamian andHittite law codes described above, barley, slaves, or other goods aresubstituted for silver because in order to correspond to an injury involvingbarley, slaves, etc.: like for like.·     Measured punishments, which, like monetary compensation for injury,allow the severity of different crimes to be compared and ranked, for exampleo   Whipping (numberof lashes)o   Prison sentences(length of time), our dominant modern form of criminal punishmentAs suggested above (and for reasons to be explicated in futureposts), compensation according to a standard amount of a standard wealth good(pre-coinage money), the outcome of coercive negotiations between clans, wasvery likely the dominant form of measured punishment during the vast majorityof the time and in the vast majority of cultures from the dawn of our speciesto today.<!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}-->InNorthern Europe, blood money and other compensation for injury was known as“wergeld”.  If the guilty party didn't have the money on hand, they needed a money-lender.     <!-- /* Font Definitions */@font-face {font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-font-charset:78; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ 明朝"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}@page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}-->Markets and the rise of variable damagesThere was very little change between the Old Hittite Laws of (c.1600 BC) and the New Hittite Laws (c. 1200 BC). But between then and the Roman Twelve Tables (c. 400BC) there was aradical shift away from fixed fees and towards variable damages, assessed byjudge or jury. This evolution was coincident with the rise of coinage, probablydue to the shift of trade in a wide variety of goods away from bilateral andhierarchical relationships and towards competitive marketplaces. Market deals werefacilitated by being able to transfer metal in branded form (coins) instead ofthe cutting and weighing of coils or hack-silver or the laborious counting ofshells (or error-prone approximations by length) which had dominated exchangeup to that time. The lowering of negotiation costs by marketplaces, coins, andother developments substantially decreased the use of customary prices in favorof prices negotiated in a market.To be continued!
The process of selling in general, and web commerce in particular, is often described or charted as a funnel. Prospective customers are poured in at one end, and a fewer number of paying customers come out at the other. The other prospects spill out through other holes or over the side of the funnel and don't bring you any revenue. The fraction of customers left, converted from prospects to customers, is called the conversion rate. As prospects proceed from initial interest to final sale, from initial entry page to clicking the final "I Agree" button, more and more of them become discouraged by various worries which beset the consumer. They drop out. The remaining prospects, those who have not dropped off, have been converted into customers or into an audience for your advertisers.There are a variety of factors that cause drop-off, which vary from business to business. A common cause is forms.  Simplifying forms often greatly increases conversion rates.  For example, in one study cutting the number of lines on a form in half increase conversions by a third. As one web designer put it: "[i]s every field you're asking the visitor to submit absolutely necessary?  Can you trim the fat and make the process simpler?"Besides the sheer tediousness and time consumed in filling out forms, rational consumers also worry about the potentials for privacy violation and identity theft from the information most e-commerce sites currently require them to divulge: physical and e-mail addresses, phone numbers used for cross-site behavioral tracking, insecure credit card numbers, and more. The tinfoil-wallet crowd is now mainstreamInstances of regret that one has filled out a form, only to have one's trust violated -- or pride among the sophisticated that they refused to fill out such a form -- are on the rise.The worst worry culprit is usually the step you most want your customers to complete -- paying you. "[T]he credit card form likely has the highest abandonment rate of any other part of the sign-up process." [Source].If you don't require payments, you are probably funding your service through advertisements. Those also cause worries. Ads typically distract and delay from the content users are after, provide a low quality of entertainment or information, and are too often offensive. And sophisticated users are worried about the tracking that tends to go with ads. Ad blocking grew nearly tenfold between 2009 and 2014. Replacing ads and identity-based payments with payments that don't require identity, such as bitcoin, can greatly reduce these worries, lowering the barriers and hesitations that currently prevent consumers from paying for your service.But there remains a big worry that no payment system can reduce.  Consumers worry about whether they are getting their money's worth -- the mental transaction cost problem (see also this paper). If e-commerce were as worry-free as some of it could be, your customers would neither have to fill out forms, nor be bothered by ads, nor have to worry about repeated charges for content or services of variable value. They would be able to just insert a few digital coins into your online vending machine and then not have to worry about losing your service for another year. Eliminate forms and eliminate repeated payments -- both are key to worry-minimized e-commerce.Many bitcoin startups are making the grave mistake of replacing one set of worries with another. The ability of cryptocurrency systems to facilitate small payments tempts many companies to nickel-and-dime their customers with pay-per-click micropayments and other such excruciating schemes. Don't follow the many lemmings who have already jumped off that cliff. Stick to long-term subscriptions for content (or other services of variable value) and pay-per-unit for fungible units of consistent value (as in phone minutes).  That way customers aren't saddled with having to constantly re-evaluate the amount and worthiness of recurring charges. The costs to your customers of having to finance a years' worth of low-cost subscription to a reputable brand is almost always far less than the mental transaction costs of recurring charges for content or services of variable value. The ideal worry-free commerce is to "stick the coin into the machine" once, and then never have to pay again for an entire year. A vending machine for subscriptions. Reduce your customers' worries across the board: eliminate forms and eliminate recurring charges.Ideal worry-minimization can only be closely approached in some purely online forms of commerce, such as video streaming, remote storage, privacy services, and the like. The more physical and offline contract performances are -- a common example being physical delivery -- the more location, various kinds of identity (legal, social network, etc.) may need to come into play, adding, often greatly and necessarily, to the worry overhead, the mental transaction costs, of your relationship with your consumers.I have previously called this worry-minimized commerce by a narrower label, "form-minimized commerce."  The complexity of the forms you make your users fill is indicative of the worries you are causing them, and thus the barriers you are putting up between your prospects and their decisions to purchase your services.When you are a consumer, the tediousness of the forms you are filling out is not only a direct cost of your time, and your ability to enjoy that time, it is on top of that a decent proxy measure of the odds of your identity being stolen and of your privacy otherwise being violated. The fewer forms you fill out, the more the tediousness, worries, and risks in your life caused by interacting with the world's institutions will drop in proportion.While such a proxy measure does not account in particular for the wide variety of information that can be disclosed, nor that some kinds of information (social security numbers) are more risky to divulge than others (throw-away email addresses),  nor for the wide variety of risks in identity theft and privacy violation that are consequent, nevertheless consumers necessarily must bring to bear such sweeping rules-of-thumb in order to satisfactorily navigate the bizarre complexities of the digital world.  And when your users are using, whether consciously or implicitly, such estimates, you the service provider and the product designer must use them too.Add to the forms your customers must fill out the repeated charges you make your customers make, and we get a rough proxy measure of the worry that you are causing your consumers:Index of worry = number of lines of forms +  number of repeated charges for content or services of variable valueIf you are funded through ads rather than consumer payments, you can substitute for the repeated charges the proportion of screen space covered by your ads, or any other reasonable estimate of the delay and distraction the ads on your pages cause.The index of worry allows you to estimate and minimize the worries you are causing your users, and as a result to minimize the drop-off in your sales funnel and maximize the number of users coming back for more -- and willing to view your ads or pay for the privilege.
Here's an edited excerpt from my old essay "Measuring Value":Tax collection is the most efficient department of government.  Its efficiency rivals that of many private sector institutions. From the point of view of many taxpayers this is an incredible claim, given that tax collectors take money we ourselves know how to spend quite well, thank you, and often spend it on amazingly wasteful activities.   And the rules by which they take it often seem quite arbitrary.   Tax rules are usually complex but nevertheless fail to let us account for many events important to the earning of our incomes that differentiate us from other taxpayers.How the money gets spent is quite outside the scope of my claim that tax collectors are uncommonly efficient.   It is the collection process itself that is the subject of that claim, and the tax collection rules.  This essay will demonstrate the efficiency of tax collector's rules by two arguments:(1) First, we will show why tax collectors have an incentive to be efficient (and what "efficiency" means in this context)(2) Second, we will explore the problem of creating tax rules, and see how the difficulty of measuring value rears its ugly head.   Tax rules solve the value measurement problem through brilliant, often very non-obvious solutions similar to solutions developed in the private and legal sectors.  Often (as, for example, with accounting) tax collectors share solutions used to measure value in private relationships (such as the absentee investor-management relationship in  joint stock corporations). It is in making these very difficult and unintuitive trade-offs, and then executing them in a series of queries, audits, and collection actions, that tax collectors efficiently optimize their revenue, even if the results seem quite wasteful to the taxpayer.The tax collector's incentives are aligned with the other branches of their government in a task that benefits all associated with the government, namely the collection of their revenue.   No organization of any type collects more revenue with fewer expenditures than tax collection agencies.   Of course, they have the advantage of coercion, but they must overcome measurement problems that are often the same as other users of accounting systems, such as owners of large companies.   It is not surprising, then,  that tax collectors have sometimes pioneered value measurement techniques, and often have been the first to bring them into large scale use.Like other kinds of auditors, the tax collector's measurement problem is tougher than it looks.  Investment manager Terry Coxon has described it well[1].  Bad measures  or inaccurate measurements allow some industries to understate their income, while forcing others to pay taxes on income they haven't really earned.  Coxon describes the result: the industries that are hurt tend to shrink.  The industries that benefit pay fewer taxes than could be extracted.  In both cases, less revenue is generated for the tax man than he might be able to get with better rules.This is an application of the Laffer curve to the fortunes of specific industries.  On this curve, developed by the brilliant economist Arthur Laffer, as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate, due to increased avoidance, evasion, and most of all disincentive to engage  in the taxed activity.    At a certain rate due to these reasons tax revenues are optimized.  Hiking the tax rate beyond the Laffer optimum results in lower rather than higher revenues for the government.  Ironically, the Laffer curve was used by advocates for lower taxes, even though it is a theory of tax collection optimum to government revenue, not a theory of tax collection optimal to social welfare or individual preference satisfaction.On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Adams[2] uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires.   The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives – both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments -- to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve.    Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.   Democratic governments may maintain high tax revenues over historical time by more peaceful means than conquering underfunded states.   They are the first states in history with tax revenues so high relative to external threats that they have the luxury of spending most of the money in non-military areas.   Their tax regimes have operated closer to the Laffer optimum than those of most previous kinds of governments.  (Alternatively, this luxury may be made possible by the efficiency of nuclear weapons in deterring attack rather than  the increased incentives of democracies to optimize to tax collection).When we apply the Laffer curve to examining the relative impact of tax rules on various industries, we conclude that the desire to optimize tax revenues causes tax collectors to want to accurately measure the income or wealth being taxed.   Measuring value is crucial to determining the taxpayer's incentives to avoid or evade the tax or opt out of the taxed activity.  For their part, taxpayers can and do spoof these measurements in various ways.  Most tax shelter schemes, for example, are based on the taxpayer minimizing reported value while optimizing actual, private value.  Tax collection involves a measurement game with unaligned incentives, similar to but even more severe than measurement games between owner and employee, investor and management, store and shopper, and plaintiff-defendant (or judge-guilty party). As with accounting rules, legal damage rules, or contractual terms, the choice of tax rules involves trading off complexity (or, more generally, the costs of measurement) for more accurate measures of value.  And worst of all, as with the other rule-making problems, rule choices ultimately ground out on subjective measures of value.    Thus a vast number of cases are left where the tax code is unfair or can be avoided.  Since tax collectors are not mind readers, tax rules and judgments must substitute for actual subjective values its judgments of what the “reasonable” or “average” person's preferences would be in the situation.  Coxon provides the following example.   Imagine that we wanted to optimize the personal income tax rules to measure income as accurately as possible.   We might start reasoning along these lines:... look a little closer and you find that an individual incurs costs and expenses in earning a salary.  He has to pay for transportation to and from work.   He may spend money on clothes he wouldn't otherwise buy and on lunches that would cost less at home.   And he may have spent thousands of dollars acquiring the skills and knowledge he uses in this work.Ideal, precise rules for measuring his income would, somehow, take all these and other costs into account.  The rules would deduct the cost of commuting (unless he enjoys traveling about town early in the morning and later in the afternoon).   They would deduct the cost of the clothes he wouldn't otherwise pay (to the extent it exceeds the cost of the clothes he would buy anyway).  They would deduct the difference between the cost of eating lunch at work and the cost of lunch at home (unless he would eat lunch out anyway).   And each year these ideal rules would deduct a portion of the cost of his education (unless he didn't learn anything useful in school or had enough fun to offset the cost).[Because there are limits to complexity, and] because tax agents can't read minds, the government gives them arbitrary rules to follow: no deductions are allowed for commuting expenses, for clothing that is suitable for wearing outside of work, for lunches that aren't part of the “business entertainment” or for the cost of acquiring the skills a job requires (although you can deduct the cost of improving your skills).The resulting rules often seem arbitrary, but they are not.   They are trade-offs, often non-obvious but brilliant,  between the costs of measuring more value with greater accuracy and extra revenue extracted thereby.   However, the value measurement problem is hardly unique to tax collection.   It is endemic when assessing damages in contract and tort law, and when devising fines punishments in administrative and criminal law.   Many private sector rules found in contracts, accounting, and other institutions also have the quality that they use highly non-obvious measures of value that turn out, upon close examination, to be brilliant solutions to seemingly intractable problems of mind-reading and the unacceptable complexity of covering all cases or contingencies.  Such measurement problems occur in every kind of economic system or relationship.   The best solutions civilization has developed to solve them are in most institutions brilliant but highly imperfect.   There is vast room for improvement, but failed large-scale experiments in attempts to improve these measures can be devastating.The Laffer curve and measurement costs can also be used to analyze the relative benefits of various tax collection schemes to government.  Prior to the industrial revolution, for example, the income tax was infeasible.   Most taxes were on the prices of commodities sold, or on various ad-hoc measures of wealth such as the frontage of one's house.  (This measurement game resulted in the very tall and deep but narrow houses that can still be found in some European cities such as Amsterdam.  The stairs are so narrow that even normal furniture has to be hauled up to the upper story and then through a window with a small crane, itself a common feature on these houses).Taxes distorted the economy of the Netherlands -- quite literally. Here are some houses in Amsterdam built in the 17th and 18th centuries, and a typical narrow staircase. Furniture and other large objects must be hauled up by the small cranes seen above the top-story windows. Prior to the industrial revolution, incomes were often a very private matter.     However, starting in England in the early nineteenth century, large firms grew to an increasing proportion of the economy.  Broadly speaking, large firms and joint-stock companies were made possible by two phases of accounting advances.   The first phase, double-entry bookkeeping, was developed for the trading banks and "super companies" of early fourteenth century Italy.  The second phase were accounting and reporting techniques developed for the larger joint stock companies of the Netherlands and England, starting with the India companies in the seventeenth century.Accounting allowed manager-owners to keep track of employees and (in the second phase) for non-management owners to keep track of managers.  These accounting techniques, along with the rise of literacy and numeracy among the workers, provided a  new way for tax collectors to measure value.  Once these larger companies came to handle a sufficient fraction of an jurisdiction's value of transactions, it was rational for governments to take advantage of their measurement techniques, and they did so -- the result being the most lucrative tax scheme ever, the income tax.References[1] Adams, Charles, For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on Civilization[2] Coxon, T., 1996 Keep What You Earn, Times Business/Random House
Mencius Moldbug and Robin Hanson are debating Robin's intriguing idea of "futarchy", which has attracted many fans. The basic idea of futarchy is "when a betting market clearly estimates that a proposed policy would increase expected national welfare, that proposal becomes law."Robin and Mencius both make some great points in this debate -- for example, Mencius observes that GDP and similar estimates of "national welfare" are poor criteria for decision-making, analogous to a corporation making decisions to maximize revenue instead of profits. GDP in the United States, for example, rose dramatically during World War II, but its standard of living was probably significantly lower for most people than in the Great Depression due to rationing, death, and other traumas of war. But both Mencius and Robin have misconstrued or vaguely glossed over two of the biggest problems with zero-sum decision markets, especially when applied to government decisions. First an observation: all prediction markets are decision markets unless the resulting prediction is so useless that nobody ever makes a decision based on it or some government somehow bans all possible kinds of decisions based on those markets. The distinction Robin and Mencius make between the two serves to obfuscate those issues that are problems with real decision markets rather than with theoretical or play prediction markets. Two of the biggest problems are:1. The problem of "morons' money", deemed by Mencius to be the money of some less-informed fraction of players who are disincentivized to play the zero-sum prediction game, actually means the money of anybody with information worse than the best player's information. Since it's a zero-sum game, and much less entertaining than sports betting, any money that is stupider than the average money has a disincentive to play -- in sharp contrast to normal positive-sum markets. But when the less-informed half of the players leave the market, we have a new half of the market that has a disincentive to play, and so on. There's only one person left for whom it would be rational to play, if there were any market left. Prediction markets can work in an experiment only because students of the professor or fans of the idea feel they have a duty to play, or want to signal to fans that they like the idea, or because there are a few people who, like the much larger population of sports bettors, find it genuinely entertaining and thus worth wasting some time and/or money on. Robin I believe has tacitly recognized this problem in his proposals to goose these markets with subsidies. But how big subsidies are needed? It's a high-risk market, so you need to guarantee a high rate of positive return to the average player to compensate for the risk if you want good information entering the market.2. Moral hazard: As I stated, prediction markets are also decision markets. We're right now going through major economic problems that stem from neglect of moral hazard. Selling securities, insurance, or betting without the investors/bettors or their agents or regulators exercising due diligence and control creates pathological incentives for people to do things like, as we've seen in the mortgage market, give cheap loans to bad credit risks because there were a bunch of number-crunchers with woefully incomplete models buying or insuring these loans who didn't understanding that most kinds of markets create additional risk by creating moral hazard, that this moral hazard must be well controlled if the market is to work, and that controlling moral hazard is usually far from straightforward. In these betting markets, which are decision markets, people inside and outside government will make their own decisions based on the market. Coercive decisions will have an especially pathological effect: they turn the zero-sum market into an overall negative-sum game. For example, a market predicting the death of someone can, as Tim May long ago observed, readily be used as an assassination market. That's why, for example, PAM, a since-abandoned effort by the U.S. Department of Defense to try out Robin's ideas for prediction markets, had a market for predicting the death of Yasser Arafat but not of George W. Bush. Since these are markets for government decisions, the decisions it drives will, like assassinations, be primarily coercive in nature, for example to wage war on country X or to tax one group of people in order to subsidize another.  If the decisions resulting from such a market were voluntary, you could just go onto a voluntary market to satisfy your needs instead of bothering with deciding that government must make some decision and then betting on its outcome. Furthermore, Mencius, although waxing entirely too rude behind his pseudonymous mask, is probably quite right that these markets will reflect the demand for desired decisions far more than a "supply" of information about how to best make that decision: per (1.), there is little to no incentive to supply such information without huge subsidies to give the markets an overall positive rate of return comparable to other high-risk markets. For example the market for "if the U.S. gives $20 billion to GM the U.S. GDP will rise by 1.1% or more [instead of the expected consensus by some group of economists of 1.0%]" will be dominated by GM, its unions, its dealers and suppliers, and so forth goosing it to a "probably true" prediction, not by people betting on the extremely uncertain, practically lost in the random noise, outcome of the proposition. If GM thinks it can sway the odds of a decision in its favor by 5% by, increasingly as the time for decision approaches, investing up to nearly $1 billion in the market, it will do so. GM has far more to gain by the gift of other people's money than arbitragers making risky bets with their own money have to gain from arbitraging the market back down to whatever they believe to be the true odds of the GDP rising 1.1%.   If GM is banned directly from participating in the market, there are numerous other parties with similar stakes in the outcome and they can't all be banned.  GM and its allies also have much to gain by lobbying the government to set up this kind of market for direct subsidies instead of futarchic markets for more generic decisions you might find more useful, such as a "remove the President if the GDP doesn't rise 1.1% or more" market. Futarchy thus becomes little more than an auction for government favors, like the time the Praetorian Guard auctioned off the emperorship to the highest bidder. It would be interesting to try straightforward government-by-the-highest-bidder. We'd probably discover why historians have equated this kind of process with corruption, but it would be well worth the suffering of some hapless residents in some small county somewhere to try the experiment and learn from it. It would of course be interesting to try out futarchy in a similarly real but small scale, restricting the players as well as the victims of the market to our guinea pig jurisdiction since there are no big GM-subsidy stakes at play. Of course, some would argue that we are living in this kind of experiment anyway, just under a blizzard of euphemisms instead of a straightforward honest auction. Others would argue that democratic voters bring no more information to governmental decisions than "moron money" would in these markets. I have no ready refutations for these arguments, but they don't prove futarchy is better than either what we have now or other possible alternative reforms.In summary, fans of prediction markets in general, and futarchy in particular, need to actually specify how to deal with moral hazard, as insurance companies and their regulators have, rather than mysterious hand-waving about the supposed "several ways to deal with it", as well as to acknowledge the need to subsidize these markets and figure out how to fairly distribute these endowments.
I saw a great constitutional law moot court at GWU today, with Chief Justice John Roberts presiding over a panel that also included 2nd Circuit Judges Guido Calabresi and Sonia Sotomayor. The Chief Justice managed to flummox both the petitioners and the respondents with his hypotheticals (factual scenarios that posed problems for their legal theories).  More here.
The recognition of common law rights that could trump legislative statute and royal edict had already long been recognized in England by the time of  Bonham's Case  in 1610:...it appears in our books, that in many cases, the common law will control acts of parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void: for when an act of parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it, and adjudge such act to be void.In the United States, Supreme Court recognition of unenumerated rights has been the norm since shortly after our Constitution was ratified, except for the short "footnote four" period during the pathological New Deal Court.  Four heroic justices fought against the stripping of "mere economic" property and contract rights, and illegal expansion of federal powers, undertaken during the New Deal.   Unfortuneately (in hindsight, given the later replacement of natural law philosophy and demotion of common law to statutory law) rather than invoking the Ninth Amendment, unenumerated rights were at first justified by the Court as a matter of natural rights.  In Calder v. Bull (1798) Justice Chase, voting with a unanimous Court, wrote:There are acts which the Federal, or State, Legislature cannot do, without exceeding their authority.  There are certain vital principles, in our free republican governments, which will determine and overrule an apparent and flagrant abuse of legislative power; as to authorize manifest injustice by positive law; or to take away that security for personal liberty, or private property, for the protection whereof the government was established.  An ACT of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law), contrary to the great first principles of the socical compact, cannot be considered a rightful exercise of the legislative authority.In the later legal positivist era they were classified as  substantive liberties under the Due Process Clause.Infamies such as Korematsu occurred soon after the New Deal Court rejected the idea of unenumerated rights.  This absolutist approach was itself effectively rejected when Griswold found an unenumerated right of privacy implied by the "penumbras" and "emanations" of the enumerated Bill of Rights.   The right of privacy was later classified as a substantive liberty under the Due Process Clause.
Wikipedia has a good short article on the distinction between negative and positive rights.    "A negative right is a right, either moral or decreed by law, to not be subject to an action of another human being (usually abuse or coercion)."  To use Justice Brandeis' famous phrase more broadly than he used it, negative rights are "rights to be left alone."  All civilized legal systems beyond the village or tribal level have been systems of negative rights.  For example, Anglo-American common law defines spheres of personal space which other persons must not invade -- especially spheres involving the body, residence, possessions, and property. The only way to create positive rights in traditional common law is to personally agree to them -- i.e. to make a contract.  The United States Constitution was drafted by people who, at least for amendments made before the 1930s, defined rights as negative rights.   Thus, when the Constitution in the Fourteenth Amendment protects the "life, liberty, or property" and "equal protection of the laws" to "any person," it is referring to acts which government must refrain from doing, not to any positive duty of the government to act.   The only time the government has a positive duty to act is when it has already deprived a person of liberty (e.g., prisoners, and arguably children compelled to attend public schools). Unfortuneately, the Court since the 1940s has departed sharply from this basci tenent of civilized law.  It has read positive rights into the Constitution, thereby depriving citizens and other persons of negative rights to which we are entitled.
Two of the most important characteristics of legal procedure are local coercion and nondeterminism.  I've written plenty about coercion recently, so here I'll put forward some thoughts about its nondeterminism.A deterministic process is one in which, for any state of the world -- a state being a theoretical description of everything that might change the future -- there is only one next state. The omniscient Laplace's daemon could in principle predict everything about the future if the universe were deterministic.   In a nondeterministic process, there can be more than one future state, and not even Laplace's daemon can know for sure, and may not know at all, which one will happen.   We can model simple processes as "state machines": in the present the process is in one state, in the next instant in the future the process may have transitioned to another state, and so on.Here's a picture of a deterministic process -- one with only one possible future:Here's a picture of a nondeterministic process:If as in the picture above there are more than two possible future states, this can also be modeled as a sequence of binary events:An event can be natural or a human act.  If it's a human act, the decision to act often can or should be based on good estimates of in which state(s) the world is or was in.  In legal procedure, generally an arrest should only be made based on an estimate that the person arrested in fact committed a specific crime, for example.If  causally related nondeterministic processes repeat themselves often enough, we can develop a probabilistic model of them.   Physicists have developed probability density models for very small-scale phenomena in quantum mechanics, for example.Practical nondeterminism stems from at least four sources: (1) some of the physical world is inherently nondeterministic, (2) even where deterministic in principle, the configuration of physical states in the world is vastly more complex than we can completely describe -- nobody and no computer comes anywhere close to resembling Laplace's demon, (3) people are far, far more complex than we can mutually comprehend -- especially if you get more than a Dunbar number of us together, and (4) the words and phrases we communicate with are often ambiguous.Most of the nondeterminism in legal procedure stems from questions of who did what when and where, and the legal consequences that should ensue based on codes and judicial opinions written in ambiguous language.   Law summarizes this uncertainty with a number of qualitative probabilities often called "burdens of proof".  The following list is sort of, but not necessarily (as they come from different legal domains and are not necessarily comparable), in order of lesser to greater burden of proof: Colorability Air of Reality Reasonable suspicion Prima facie case Probable cause Preponderance of the evidence Clear and convincing evidence Beyond reasonable doubt (To reverse a jury verdict) No reasonable jury could have reached the verdictThese label the probabilities -- not in the sense of numbers between 0 and 1, but in the sense of kinds of evidence and degrees of convincing argument -- required for various decisions of legal procedure to be made: for a search warrant to issue, for an arrest to be made, for property to be confiscated, for a legal motion to be accepted or denied, for liability to accrue in a civil trial, for a sentence of guilty in a criminal trial, for decisions about jurisdiction, and so on.It's useful to look at these, not merely as classical probabilities, but in the style of quantum physics, as a superposition of states.  When a nondeterministic event -- or a deterministic event for which we lack important knowledge -- has happened in the past, we can treat it as a superposition of all the possible events that might have happened.  When a person or persons undertakes a procedural act -- arrests a person, issues a verdict, and so on -- under law they should be doing so based on a judgment, to some degree of certainty, that one particular set of facts occurred that justify the act.  We can thus see a criminal defendant, for example, as in the state "guilty or not guilty" until a jury "collapses" this probability distribution to a verdict (which collapse, however, unlike quantum mechanics, can sometimes be reversed by an appeals court if deemed erroneous).    A suspect is in the state "beyond reasonable suspicion" or "not beyond reasonable suspicion" until a police officer acts, for example to pull over your car on the highway, in a way that requires reasonable suspicion.  In principle, at least, this decision too shoul dbe reversible (for example, if the officer pulled over your car without reasonable suspicion and noticed an open beer bottle, that evidence could be thrown out of court based on the lack of reasonable suspicion in the original stop).Legal procedure needs to control nondeterminism so that people can operate in an environment of reasonably reliable legal rights.  Think, for example, about how inefficient the economy would be if most property was in imminent danger of being taken from one owner and given to another due to frequent decisions reversing old court cases,  or how full of worry our lives would be if we could be taken off the street and put in jail at random.  Thus there is, for example, a strong presumption in English-law countries that a jury's decision is final: and this effected by putting the burden of proof on the court reversing the decision high: "no reasonable jury could have reached the verdict", a burden of proof in a criminal case much higher than the jury's own "beyond reasonable doubt."
Dennis Crouch reports that, while some of its provisions might be snuck into appropriations bills, the Patent Act of 2005 itself is history.  I predict that most of its provisions will be revived in 2006.
The classic economic account of the origins of money is that of Carl Menger. Menger described money as emerging out of markets where commodoties were bartered. Barter markets were inefficient, Menger explained, because a double coincidence of wants was required before a trade could be consumated. One way to solve this would be credit, but credit is a very imperfect institution for a variety of reasons. Another way to solve the problem is the intermediate commodity -- a commodity that everybody is willing to take or give in trade. This would start by being an otherwise useful commodity, but eventually it would be come to be valued more, or even entirely, for its monetary attributes (i.e. its attributes as an intermediate commodity, such as durability, divisability, the ability to be securely stored, etc.) Thus would money naturally emerge from the operations of a barter market.Menger's theory is valuable in a number of ways. The coincidence of wants problem is a crucial idea as well as illustrating the Austrian economic ideas of time and subjective preferences. Menger's theory provides a good example of how economic institutions can emerge, it demonstrates that (contrary to modern legal definitions) money need not be created by any sort of government, and it suggests that the emergence of money long predated the invention of coinage. And Menger's theory is true insofar as a barter market would evolve in the way Menger describes. However, as an actual description of the origins of money it is almost surely wrong -- or alternatively, it is even more right than he could have known. This is because money, in the form of collectibles such as shells, predated low transaction cost commodity markets by tens of thousands of years.Money (or, if you prefer to stick to modern legal definitions of money, proto-money which I call "collectibles") emerged far sooner than barter markets because the double coincidence of wants problem occurs not only in barter exchanges, but in other transactions that were as or more important than barter to hunter-gatherer societies: paying tribute, paying legal fines, bride price, and mortuary distribution (inheritance). Furthermore, barter exchanges in these societies usually resembled far more a bilateral monopoly than an efficient market exchange. Use of shell jewelry or similar objects in hunter-gatherer and neolithic societies for these purposes is nearly universal. Nevertheless, in all these kinds of transactions a double (or more) coincidence of wants and events (such as death, marriage, or legal judgment) is required if they are done in-kind rather than with objects with good monetary properties; the best such objects available were usually shells, often strung on necklaces providing secure storage and divisibility.Furthermore, these appeared long enough ago (mature shell jewelry is found now back to 75,000 B.P.) that the (begging) explanation "people collected shells and made jewelry for pleasure" may be backwards -- humans may well have evolved the pleasure of collection because of the evolutionary benefits of greater cooperation. Lowered transaction costs for all these kinds of transactions meant greater familial, political, legal, and economic cooperation -- i.e. the enhancement of kin altruism as well as reciprocal altruism and the mitigation of aggression.This is spelled out in detail in my Shelling Out: The Origins of Money
I've written generally on the problem of measuring value. Civilization has progressed when we've discovered how to use better, but often quite non-obvious, proxy measures of value. One important kind of value measurement problem is estimating the inflation or deflation of a currency.  The most popular estimate is a consumer price index (CPI) using weighted indexes of prices of a basket of goods and services.  The CPI in turn is used to compute adjustments for inflation-indexed securities and pension schemes and"real" values for things like GDP, productivity, and so on. Richard Vermillion at Quicksilver Sulfide has a good post on the limitations of weighted price indexes for such purposes.I agree wholeheartedly that incomparability is a big problem for the CPI. I conclude that the CPI, and thus indexed investments and pensions and various "real" estimates of GDP and productivity are heavily error-prone and bias-prone. It is doubtful, however, that these problems "systematically make[] us overestimate inflation." Some other proxy measures of inflation suggest the opposite is the case.If one may generalize, technological progress over the last five years has increased value and decreased prices faster than other factors (e.g. rising regulations, rising money supply, and other political problems) have increased them in arguably luxury or zero-sum areas like entertainment and office bureaucracy (e.g. the oft cited rapidly falling costs and increased capabilities computers and associated products). But political factors have (to various degrees depending on your unit of measure) increased prices faster than rising technological productivity in traditional necessity areas such as food, housing, and energy. Furthermore, the problems Vermillion points out with choosing units of measurement (gallons of gas or miles driven?) are multiplied or exponentiated when it comes to comparing the value of gadgets that play music or movies or allow us to spiel on the Internet.What is a luxury and what is a necessity is itself quite debatable, and most categories are part luxury and part necessity. Prices of underlying real estate are mostly necessity (we need to be within commuting distance of our jobs), but the prices of houses themselves (especially after the big increases in square footage) are increasingly luxury. I take a long view and a global view, under which agriculture and its inputs (over the last century including oil) has been the dominantly important industry for about ten millenia and is still a crucial industry. Just because water is far cheaper than diamonds, or flour is cheaper than cable TV, to such an extent that we can spend more on the latter than the former, doesn't mean water should be (or in fact subjectively is) weighed far less than diamonds or bread less than a month's subscription to cable. Even though Americans probably spend more on cable TV than on food calories (or at least more than we could spend if we didn't insist on ingredients and recipes and modes of delivery until recently considered luxuries), there would be far more suffering if the price of food calories went up by a factor of ten than if the price of cable TV did so. People once found and will find other ways to entertain themselves without cable, but we can't do without calories. (Many of us Americans would be healthier with a few less calories, but that goes for cable TV too).There is a vast amount of interconnection between the different factors. Fuel mileage and thus the productivity of a mile of commuting may be up, but urban and suburban real estate prices and the associated commute distances probably have more than offset this factor in the ten years (not to mention value lost from extra time spent commuting instead of more enjoyable or productive activities).We could just leap over these variously biased and error-prone indexes if we could observe how people value a dollar tomorrow versus a dollar today -- time preferences. Although there are other influences on time preferences, I hypothesize that the dominant influence on time preferences overall for users of a currency is the expectation of inflation in that currency. Even if we can't accurately measure an overall rate of inflation, due to the problems Vermillion describes, we may be able to find a good proxy measure for it if we can find a good proxy measure for the overall time preference of currency users that doesn't involve first computing a "real" rate of interest.People sense price rises in the things they value, and thus come to their own estimates of past inflation, i.e. rises in the costs of their own budget due to external causes, and  expectations of future inflation in the prices of things they value. I argue that this subjective inflation, and the expectation of future subjective inflation, are what a money issuer really ought to target: the issuer should observe proxy measures that most closely approximate overall subjective inflation expectation, and expectations of same, and expand or contract the money supply,  via discount rates or otherwise, accordingly.For the purposes of estimating subjective inflation, I don't think interest rates work as a proxy measure. Here's why, giving as an example today's U.S. dollar interest rates. If dollar inflation is lower than the CPI indicates, as Vermillion argues, then real interest rates are positive, showing that folks prefer to spend a dollar on todays's technologically inferior and more pricier goods over a dollar on tommorrow's superior and less expensive goods. But if consumers have such "Luddite" or risk averse commodity preferences, then inflation may be much higher than Vermillion or the CPI suggest, meaning real interest rates aren't really positive. Using interest rates as an indicator of time preferences introduces a circularity when arguing for or against such preferences for the purposes of properly weighing a basket of goods.Another problem of using interest rates as a proxy measure for inflation expectations is that it is biased by investor behavior and in particular foreign inflows or outflows of dollars. If there is a larger dollar supply in the world returning home to the U.S. and chasing fewer investment opportunities, that will drive down interest rates despite subjective inflation expectations. If the economy using dollars is shrinking (either because the economy itself is shrinking or because some other currency is gaining favor, supplanting the use of dollars) and the dollar supply fails to shrink along with it, the result is both inflation and low interest rates.A better measure of consumer time preferences, and thus per the argument above consumer inflation expectations, may be to look at savings rates. Savings rates here in the U.S. strongly suggest that people aren't saving up to buy computers or audio or video players two years from now because these gadgets will be very important to us and more functional and cheaper than today. Rather, increasingly U.S. consumer budgets are going into goods and services that have been rising much faster than the CPI, especially housing and education. The negative savings rate strongly suggests, as do the price trajectories of the most objectively comparable goods (commodities and housing), that the CPI has for the last five years been understating inflation, and that interest rates in the U.S. are too low compared to this inflation to induce Americans at least to save here. (Foreigners are investing vast sums here, but that's another story). If Americans have been spending as if their dollars will be worth less tomorrow than today, perhaps we should respect that perception, technological progress in entertainment and office bureaucracy notwithstanding.The correlation between time preferences observed in U.S. consumer savings rates and a "consumer price index" far more heavily weighted towards necessities than today's CPI suggests either that (a) goods on the luxury end where productivity has been increasing tend to be "zero sum" status goods, or entertainment goods that only temporarily make us happier, so that the productivity increases won't actually make us much happier in the future, and thus don't effect much our time preferences compared to "positive sum" and "we'd be far less happy without them" necessities, or (b) that time preferences are very risk averse, and thus strongly weigh future water over future diamonds, despite our spending more on the latter in the present, or (c) a combination of both these factors. In both cases there are rational arguments to make for such preferences and in any case we should respect them and choose the units and weights of our price indexes consistent with them.Another reason to believe the U.S. CPI, at least, underestimates inflation is the intuitive argument that the organization that created the formula for the CPI (i.e. the federal government) is also the organization that stands to pay out vastly greater sums on i-bonds, Social Security, and so on should the inflation rates it reports go up.   Even small biases in reporting inflation today lower the federal government's future liabilities by vast sums.   It is also hard to recognize and correct any bias, since due to incomparability CPI units and weights could be debated ad infinitum.  There is a wide lattitude of government choice among CPI weights and measures that cannot be proven to be right or wrong.    Why would they not choose the values that best meet their budget preferences?  However, to make this argument correctly one should invoke public choice or similiar theory rather than treating government as if it has the incentives of an individual; such an analysis is beyond the scope of this post.Whether or not we can find other proxy measures for inflation, Vermillion's basic point about incomparability and the dubious nature of the units and weights used in price indexes is correct. Unless there is a good substitute proxy measure for subjective time preferences and thus subjective inflation, (perhaps the savings rate as suggested above), we are stuck with weighted indexes. But measures based on these weighted indexes, including measuring the "real" values of GDP or of particular sectors or goods, measuring "inflation," and measuring "productivity" -- all these suffer from the incomparability of the goods and services in the index, and thus are much more error-prone, much more bias-prone, and indeed, much more prone to badly incentivized manipulation and fraudulent accounting than the usual economic pundits and advisors have been assuming.
Clay Shirky describes how micropayments proponent Scott McCloud seems to have thrown in the towel, and he points to my old micropayments paper.  A few comments on Shirky's excellent description of the micropayments problem and on my old paper may be in order.  When I wrote that paper I thought of micropayments as payments of a granularity smaller than the 1 cent granularity of traditional prices, or very close to it.   My prediction was that the granularity of payments on the Internet would be somewhat higher than traditional price granularity.  This was in a response to the fascinating Digital Silk Road/Agorics idea that you could buy and sell IP packet transmission, memory space, and the like at unprecedentedly low granularities like a thousandth of a cent.  There is basically no important computational transaction cost barrier to such payments, but I described mental transaction cost barriers that still have not been surmounted.  The efforts of micropayment engineers focusing on computational rather than mental transaction costs were and are misguided.So when the Post Office raises postage rates by 1 cent, or charges a few cents more for one class of mail than another, that's very close to what I thought of as a micropayment and is what I was predicting would be very hard (not impossible) to do productively on the Internet. But when iTunes sells a song for a dollar, regardless of how popular the song is, that's a price granularity that is sufficiently high to overcome mental transaction costs.  Nowadays many people call even a dollar a "micropayment" because it's smaller than your typical credit card payment, and this muddles the issue.  Paypal and some services like iTunes have shown that there's at least a significant niche market below typical minimum credit card payment, but it hasn't shown that micropayments of the kind I talked about are feasible.I don't claim that price granularities of near 1 cent or below will never make economic sense on the Internet, but they do require a sophisticated attention to preference revelation and mental transaction costs that so far has generally been lacking.   Something like micropayments, or at least low-granularity accounting, is happening on the advertising payment end rather than the consumer payment end.  The business of selling eyeballs wholesale is much better able to automate the sophisticated accounting and auditing that is required for such schemes to work.  Some proxy measures for eyeballs, e.g. based on "hits", have proven to be feasible when computers rather than humans can reliably do the counting at any granularity below thousands.  Arguably some online games have also achieved low price granularities, although here payments are part of the entertainment value of the game (as in traditional games like Monopoly(tm)) rather than just a necessary transaction cost.  The extent to which iTunes and the like can compete with free content is another issue which Shirky describes well.  This competition interacts with price granularity insofar as the mental transaction costs put a floor on content prices and competition from free content (artists seeking fame rather than money) puts a ceiling on content prices.  Shirky plausibly argues that there is little or (ultimately) no room in between this floor and ceiling leaving little and perhaps ultimately no significant market for online content funded directly by the consumer.Here are a couple more aspects of micropayments and price granularity I have long believed but I'm not sure I've sufficiently made clear:(1) As more low-wealth people get on the Internet, price granularity will naturally fall as such consumers are generally willing to put more effort and attention into shopping per money saved.  Much of the reason price granularity has been higher on the Internet is because its users have higher than average wealth.  However, unlike point (2) below this effect is not very large and won't by itself get us below traditional price granularities.  (2) Where the mental transaction/preference revelation problem can be solved for high-wealth consumers at 1 cent granularity for a particular kind of Internet transaction, there is nothing magical about 1 cent, and it might well be easy to further reduce price granularity to a thousandth or a millionth of a cent.  In that sense I'm a big fan of the agorics approach -- since "micropayments" has been taken to include much larger payments perhaps we could call them "nanopayments" -- and I hope I haven't overly discouraged people from looking at these fascinating and potentially quite lucrative and revolutionary possibilities.
The following, from a larger article of mine, serves as an introduction to the idea of blind signatures and their use in digital cash and other digital bearer certificates:IntroductionMeet the greatest simple equation since e=mc2:gSf(m) = S(m) S is a digital signature, f is the blinding function, and g an unblinding function. The blinding functions are usually based on a secret random number called the "blinding factor". m is another random number, a unique identifier which can, for example, refer to an instance of some object.The idea is very clever but very simple. It may be counterintuitive because the simplest physical world metaphor of this highly useful e-commerce primitive sounds worse than useless: Alice can get Carol to sign a blank check! Here's how:(1) Alice generates m and blinds it. "Blinding" is just a one-time-pad encryption to oneself, f(m). She sends this to Carol. This is like taking a piece of paper and sealing it inside an envelope which Carol can't open or see through.(2) Carol signs it: Sf(m), and sends this back to Alice.   This is like Carol signing the outside of the envelope.(3) Alice unblinds it: gSf(m) = S(m).   Carol has also signed the paper Alice put inside the envelope!The genius behind this discovery: cryptography  guru DavidChaum.  The brilliance lies in step 3: Chaum discovered thatsome signatures have the property of being "commutative"with the blinding functions: Alice can strip off the blindingin the reverse order which the blinding and signaturewere applied, leaving just Alice's signature of n.  It is as ifAlice put a piece of  carbon paper inside the envelope.In particular for RSA signatures, with public key (pq, e)and private key d, the blind signature functions are the followingmodulo pq:S(x) = xdg(x) = xk-1f(x)= xkeWe can check that the blind signature property holds:gSf(m) = (m(ke))d * k-1       = md * k * k-1= md which is the valid RSA signature of private key d on m.Unlinkable TransfersDistinguish between either a counter or third party tracing one person's true name, via lack of or weak communications mix, and a third party linking two entities (whether nyms, use-more-than-once-addresses, account numbers, or true names) as being involved in the same transaction. By unlinkability herein we mean the latter. The goal where true names are used (this occurs, for example, when using true name accounts or not using good communications mixes), is to prevent third party linking of two people doing business with each other. Where nyms are used the goal is to minimize the release of traffic information, to prevent the unwanted accumulation of unique behavior patterns, which could be used to link nyms (including to their true names), or could augment other means of breaching privacy. Blinding especially helps where rights holders want to keep third party or public accounts denominated in generic rights. In that case a communications mix doesn't even in principle give us what blinding does.Besides protecting against the transfer agent, Chaum's transferor-, transferee-, and double-blinding protocols protect against collusion of a party with a transfer agent to identify the countparty account or nym.Unlinkability can be provided by combining a list of cleared certificates with blind signatures and a delay-mixing effect. Enough instances of a standardized contract [or specifically with digital cash, standard denominations of money] are issued over a period of time to create a mix. Between the issuing and clearing of a certificate, many other certificates with the same signature will be cleared, making it highly improbable that a particular clearing can be linked to a particular issue via the signature. There is a tradeoff between the mixing effect and the exposure to the theft of a "plate" for a particular issue: the smaller the issue, the smaller the exposure but the greater the linkability; a larger issue has both greater exposure and greater confidentiality.Blind signatures can be used to make certificate transfers unlinkable via serial number. Privacy from the transfer agent can take the form of transferee- unlinkability, transferor-unlinkability, or "double blinded" where both transferor and transferee are unlinkable by the transfer agent or a collusion of a transfer agent and counterparty.A use-once-address communications mix plus foreswearing any reputation gain from keeping accounts, in theory also buys us unlinkability, but a communications mix is weak and very expensive.Bearer certificates come in an "online" variety, cleared during every transfer, and thus both verifiable and observable, and an "offline" variety, which can be transferred without being cleared, but is only verifiable when finally cleared, by revealing any the clearing name of any intermediate holder who transferred the object multiple times (a breach of contract).This unlinkability is often called "anonymity", but the issue of whether accounts are issued to real names or pseudonyms, and whether transferor and transferee identify themselves to each other, is orthogonal to unlinkability by the transfer agent in the online model. In the off-line model, account identification (or at least a highly reputable and/or secured pseudonym) is required: passing an offline certificate a second time reveals this identity. Furthermore, communications channels can allow Eve to link transferor and transferee, unless they take the precaution of using an anonymous remailer. Online clearing does make lack of identification a reasonable option for many kinds of transactions, although common credit and warrantee situations often benefit from or even require identification.When confronting an attempted clearing of a cleared serial number, we face an error-or-fraud dilemma similar to the one we encountered above in double entry bookkeeping. The ecash(tm) protocol from DigiCash actually takes advantage of on purpose to recover from a network failure. When certificates are lost over the net it is not clear to the transferor whether they have been received and cleared by the transferee or not. Second-transferring directly with the transfer agent resolves the ambiguity. This only works with the online protocol. The issue of distinguishing error from fraud is urgent in the offline protocol, but there is as yet no highly satisfactory solution. This problem is often intractable due to the subjectivity of intent.With ideal two-way anonymous communications between use-once keys, and completely accountless clearing, unlinkability via blind signatures becomes redundant. This ideal case has yet to be even closely approached with implemented technology, and necessarily involves long communications delays which are often intolerable. Real imperfect communications mixes and less expensive blinded tokens complement each other.
Should we be more worried about death by terrorist, or death by government? Matthew White and R.J. Rummel put our current hysteria in perspective.
Congress is going crazy over commodities, and especially over oil.   They are convinced that we have a commodities bubble, so that all they have to do is smash down their boogymen, "the speculators", and all will be hunky dory.  They are convinced of this because those supply/demand curves in the first chapter of our Econ 101 textbook no longer seem to be working for commodities.This article provides an overview of the state of the commodities markets -- follow the links for more explanation of the various topics.Those supply/demand curves in the first chapter of your Econ 101 textbook assumed that goods are sold for some fix standard of value, a currency.  But under floating currencies, which the world has had since the U.S. went off gold in 1970, there is no fixed standard of value.  When trading commodities, supply and demand for the currencies they are traded for must now be taken into account.  A long commodity position is also a short currency position, and vice versa.  Furthermore, expectations about future supply and demand for currencies must be accounted for.   Under floating currencies and a free market in commodities, commodity prices, especially for commodities like oil and gold where the stockpile (whether below or above ground) to production ratio is very high and storage costs low, are highly volatile – a small change in inflation expectations causes a very large change in commodity prices.  The commodities themselves start to act like gold: to take on monetary functions such as a store of value or a hedge for currency-denominated debt.  The logical emergence of money from barter is taking place every day as commodities come to serve these monetary functions better than floating currencies.The critics complain that commodities markets, no longer reflecting Econ 101 supply and demand, are no longer providing reliable price signals.  In fact commodity prices still are reflecting Econ 101 supply and demand, but this often tends to get buried in the noise of the much larger price changes caused by changes in inflation expectations.  The fault lies with poorly managed floating currencies, not with attempts by currencies users to protect against the damage done by floating currencies, for example by hedging their dollar-denominated investment portfolios with long commodity positions.  Trying to stop "speculation" will be like curing a fever by attacking the immune system.  You may get rid of the fever, but you won't get rid of the flu, and the patient, no longer protected, may end up six feet under.The evidence for all this, such as the great rise in the use of commodity derivatives and commodity index ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and ETNs (exchange-traded notes) by long-term investors such as pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds, in parallel the great recent rises in commodity prices, are lumped by critics under their derogatory label of "speculation."  Another, and probably even larger, source of the oil run-up are decisions by producers to keep oil in the ground (where its storage costs are cheapest) rather than pump it only to sell it for depreciating dollars.   Similarly, there has been a great deal of informal "hoarding" of food.  Here the commodity is being stored by those who expect to consume, or who expect their customers to consume, the commodity in the future.  The stockpile is a hedge against both the falling currencies and political risk that governments might hoard and ration the food.  This “tacit speculation” too reflects an increase in inflation expectations.  If or when inflation expectations decrease, we can expect (contrary to “peak oil” theory) oil pumping to greatly increase, as having dollars will once again become more valuable than having oil in the ground, and we can expect informal food stockpiles to be drawn down and food prices to drop.These are all attempts to preserve wealth in the face of a highly uncertain, and probably falling, value of the future dollar and other floating currencies.  In the era of floating currencies, not only are commodities a legitimate asset class, they are an essential asset class.  Floating currencies add a very large and dominating amount of noise to commodity price signals when inflation expectations change, but there is no easy fix for this problem. Attacks against commodity "speculation" are attacks against efforts to protect property and markets against highly uncertain currencies.  Without this protection, economies will be in grave danger of wealth destruction.  Instead of attacking "speculation", the great increase in trade of "paper barrels" or "video barrels" should be encouraged.  The more commodities can be traded as bits instead of by shipping physical commodities, the lower the transaction costs that will be imposed on tradition physical delivery markets.  The "rolling-over" of commodities futures -- when expiring futures are swapped for distant futures instead of taking delivery of the physical commodity -- should be formalized in long-term commodities  securities that minimally disrupt traditional "commercial" commodity hedging operations. We may be seeing only the first stages of a switch from floating currencies, which may be proving to be unworkable, to commodity-backed currencies.  Floating currencies were and are a great historical experiment, and there is no guarantee that such experiments will work out in the long run. By serving monetary functions such as stores of value and hedges against currency-denominated debt, commodity index ETFs and ETNs are starting to serve as monetary substitutes.  But the benefits so far have been limited to investors and other big players.  Those saving for retirement or who will have to pay for their child's education are benefitting from the use of commodity long positions to stablize pension and endowment funds against falling currencies and protect them against future inflation.  But we still have to take our wages in floating currencies, hold our checking and savings accounts in floating currencies, and pay or be paid our debts in floating currencies.  Can commodity money move from Wall Street to Main Street?There are, alas, great legal barriers to retail commodity money.  While legal barriers often just increase costs by a few basis points for Wall Street, they usually prove insuperable for the man in the street.  To remove these legal barriers, contracts in any part of the economy should be allowed to use commodity index ETFs or other standards of choice as payment terms.  Negotiable instruments law in the U.S. must be changed to allow payments by check, money order, etc. in commodity standards to compete against government currencies on a level playing field.  Legal tender laws requiring an option to pay debts in particular currencies should be eliminated in order to allow payment terms denominated in commodity indices to be as simple as payment terms denominated in dollars.  These kinds of reforms will bring the benefits of stable commodity money from Wall Street to the man in the street. If the Federal Reserve decided to use leading indicators (e.g. commodities) instead of trailing indicators (e.g. the Consumer Price Index, CPI) to fight inflation, or decided to go to a de facto commodity index or back to the gold standard, and stopped bad practices such as "printing" dollars to swap for dubious real estate securities, we would not need to otherwise use commodities for monetary purposes.  If the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank prove incable of providing a stable currency, commodity money will provide the long-term stability that our floating currencies since 1970 have usually not exhibited. The more governments try to fight the use of commodities for monetary purposes, the more painful the effects of poorly managed floating currencies will be, and the more painful the resulting transition from those floating currencies to commodity money will be.
Perhaps the two most important factors contributing to a neolithic, ancient, or medieval civilization were the productivity and security of farmland.  Over these times (almost all of recorded history) productivity and security (largely, but by no means entirely, involving warfare techniques and organization) were probably the two main factors determining the ownership (or more generally control) of farmland and thus the structure of an agriculturally dominated society.Which of these two factors were more important?  Many traditional historians take it for granted that military organization (often determined by military technology) determined social structure as well as the success of a society.  Thus, for example, the theory that the stirrup gave rise to feudalism.  Some other historians or scientists who study history take it for granted that crop productivity, primarily determined by ecology and technology, was more important to the success of a civilization or to determining its political, legal, and economic institutions.Neither view is correct.  Farm productivity and farm security interact, and institutions are at least as important to determining that productivity and security as the reverse.  A few historians have started analyzing the interaction between crop productivity and security in a variety of detailed ways, an approach I think may shed quite a bit of light on history.One common strategy of ancient warfare was to "devastate" enemy crops.  Historian and viticulturalist Victor Davis Hanson has studied the vines, olive trees, and some grain varieties grown in ancient Greece and has shown that they could often withstand intentional destruction (burning, chopping, digging up, etc.) rather well.  I further suspect that plants in most places and times were bred, not merely for their nutritional content, and not merely to withstand weeds and animal pests, but to withstand such assaults from human pests as well.Furthermore, I hypothesize that the pattern of control or ownership of land, and thus property law (and political structure in general) will vary depending upon the interaction of agricultural productivity and security, and vice versa.  To flesh out this theory I will make some corollary "geostrategic" hypotheses about neolithic, ancient, classical, and medieval  warfare:* There are some economies of scale in protecting farmland.  An obvious economy of scale is that the area (a good proxy measure for value) of farmland increases as the square of the length of boundary that must be guarded.* There are some diseconomies of scale in protecting farmland.  An important diseconomy of scale is that it becomes more difficult to coordinate ever larger armies (the knowledge problem familiar to Austrian economists) and to coordinate the tax collection needed to fund those armies.* There is a tension between the optimal size of a farm for the application of organizational labor and technology and the optimal size for military protection.  If security needs become too great, the two can become mismatched and farm productivity will fall.  If this is not to occur some military coordination between landowners is needed (this may be feudal, or democratic/agrarian as in the classic Greek polis, or a wide variety of other kinds of coordination including the modern state).* Geographic features can help protect farmland, allowing its size and organization to be optimized for productivity.  Which geographic features are important depends on the scale on which farmland is defended.  During many eras of history (from large-scale feudal coordination to the state) such coordination has occurred on a large scale.  Thus, it may be no coincidence that two large islands which have been largely or entirely protected from invasion for hundreds of years, Japan and Britain, also had among the highest agricultural productivities per acre during that period as well as the greatest cultivation of even marginal arable lands.  Italy's situation is similar being protected on one side by the Alps and three other sides by water.  Italy and Japan, though often divided politically during this era, are long and thin, making disputed internal boundaries shorter.  In some areas (such as the Low Countries) inhabitants went to great lengths to create water barriers between themselves and invading armies.  Contrariwise, this theory predicts agricultural productivity will be lowest in unprotected continental regions.  Indeed, interior continental regions easily reached by horse tended to be given over to much less productive nomadic grazing.  Security constraints were probably what prevented any sort of crop from being grown.Some of the inspiration for this theory comes from Adam Smith, in Book 3 of The Wealth of Nations.  Smith pointed out that there was a large mismatch between land ownership patterns that provided the best incentives to productively use the land and laws derived from feudal protection needs.  Under English law there were a variety of kinds of land ownership, called "estates."  Smith advocated straight ownership called "fee simple" that allowed land to be divided among children, bought and sold, and used as collateral.  The two now curious but formerly common kinds of estates Smith observed and criticized were "primogeniture," in which land could not be divided among children but had to be devised to the oldest male, and "fee tail," or restraints against transferring the property or using it as collateral.  In the Middle Ages land ownership was bundled with the ability to protect the land.  The law thus prevented foolish heirs from dividing up their land into portions too small to protected.  These restraints also protected the tenants who actually worked the land.  Smith, living on an island well protected by the navy of a single state, observed that England was moving away from that kind of ownership and advocated getting rid of it altogether, pointing out its economic wastefulness. As evidence Smith cited large tracts of poorly cultivated or entirely uncultivated land in farms still under those feudal property law constraints.  Furthermore, we have seen the importance of the ability to use land as collateral.  Collateralization of land probably ocurred first on a large scale in late medieval Italy.   This may be due to its greater adherence to the traditions of Roman law (in which land was divided equally among children and was freely transferable) as well as its relatively secure geography.The crucial role of security for the history of farming may also shed light on the birth of agricultural in the first place.  Hunter-gatherers were very knowledgeable about plants and animals, far more than the typical modern.  It would not have taken a genius -- and there were many, as their brains were as large as ours -- to figure out that you can plant a seed into the ground and it will grow.  There must have been, rather, some severe institutional constraints that prevented agriculture from arising in the first place.  The basic problem is that somebody has to protect that seedling for several months from enemies, and then has to harvest it before the enemy (or simply a envious neighbor) does.  Security and allocation of property rights between providers of security and providers of farm labor were the intractable problems that took vast amounts of trial and error as well as genius to solve in order for agriculture to take root.
Hegelianism was an exercise in intellectual hubris which easily misled its followers into political hubris. Hegel's antithesis-thesis-synthesis structure came straight out of medieval law schools.  This dialectical method was (and with some variations and changes of terminology still is) used where, under the facts of a dispute, the law as it stands is arguably ambiguous.  Legal scholars analyze the legal arguments of plaintiff (thesis) and defense (antithesis) and reconcile these arguments in order to reach a just verdict and a more comprehensive and clear rule of law (synthesis).  Later in the Middle Ages, but still long before Hegel, the dialectical method spread, with variations and changes of terminology, to some other branches of university study (e.g. theology and science), but its success was still quite dependent on the availability of a rich set of facts from which to use the method to induce laws.  Thus, for example, phrases like "law of nature" and "scientific law" stem from this origin of the inductive scientifc method.The real value of dialectics in interpersonal matters comes from taking a specific dispute between two specific people, with very specific and well investigated facts, and inductively reaching a new clarification or minor variation on a rule of law, custom, or manners (synthesis) that achieves a just outcome for this dispute.This is how the law is supposed to evolve, inductively, slowly, case by case over many centuries. This is how good law is "made" by judges.  But in the hands of a dogmatic philospher like Hegel or Marx, dialectics became an exercise in faux implied omniscience -- the idiotic but compelling hubris we can trace the broad path of history itself through the movements of major opposing ideas (Hegel) or economic factions (Marx), and through this cabalistic exercise learn the "laws of history" which culminate in the idealistic outcome already desired by the philosopher, whether the supremacy of the State (Hegel) or an egalitarian utopia (Marx).  Divorced from the reality of details and the patience of evolution, the outcome in real socieities, though labelled "progressive" (in honor of the direction of history as "discovered", i.e. as desired and cabalistically justified, by these philosphers) -- though called "progressive", the actual outcome was more often than not quite in the opposite direction.  The actual outcome was analogous to what a genetic engineer would get if (with our limited knowledge of the workings of genes and the proteins they code for) said bioengineer cut and hacked thousands of genes and then reassembled them in a more "rational" manner.  All that bioengineer would get out of such a naive and radical procedure is monsters and death.  Our genetic code is far too complex to change more than a few genes at a time.   Our interpersopnal relationships, and thus our society and our politics, is far more complex still.  That is why we got even more monsters and death from Hegel, Marx, and their many naive and radical followers.
We have seen that U.S. Rep. David Crockett, later a hero of the Alamo, argued passionately against the propriety and constitutionality of federal charity.  Crockett told his fellow Representatives that taxpayer money was "not yours to give."  During the first several decades after the U.S. Constitution was enacted, constitutional issues were debated and decided far more often in Congress than in the Supreme Court.  Crockett was part of a long line of early and eminent Congressional constitutionalists who argued against the constitutionality of federal charity.  Another was James Madison, one of the main drafters of the Constitution as well as one of its main proponents in the Federalist Papers.  Opposing moderate Federalists and Republicans were were radical Federalists who argued following Alexander Hamilton for practically unlimited federal powers.   According to Crockett, Madison, and many others, Congress had no power under any clause of the Constitution to allocate money for charity, except when such charity was necessary and proper (using a fairly narrow construction of that phrase) for implementing an enumerated Congressional power such as funding and governing the armed forces, paying federal debts, executing the laws, or implementing treaties.David P. Currie's book The Constitution in Congress chronicles these early constitutional debates and is a must read for constitutional scholars.  It contains debates by many House members (including James Madison, Elbridge Gerry, and other founders and drafters) on the constitutionality of many different kinds of legislation.  Currie cites the Annals of the early Congress which are now online.  Currie discussses the following two debates on federal charity:(1) In 1793, a number of French citizens were driven out of the French Colony of Hispaniola (now Haiti), landed in Baltimore, and petitioned Congress for financial assistance.  Rep. John Nicholas expressed doubt that Congress had the constitutional authority "to bestow the money of their constituents on an act of charity."[1]  Rep. Abraham Clark responded that "in a case of this kind, we are not to be tied up by the Constitution." [2].   Rep. Elias Boudinot, another radical Federalist, argued that the general welfare clause authorized this kind of spending.[3]  Rep. James Madison resolved the debate by observing that the U.S. owed France money from the Revolutionary War.  Madison disagreed with the radical Federalist interpretation of the general welfare clause and argued against setting a dangerous precedent for open-ended spending.  Congress could, however, provide money to the French refugees in partial payment of these debts, and thus constitutionally under Congress' Article I powers to pay federal debts.[4](2)   The second opportunity to debate the constitutionality of federal charity occurred when a fire destroyed much of the previously thriving city of Savannah, Georgia in 1796.  The fire was referred to as a "national calamity."  Rep. John Milledge related how "[n]ot a public building, not a place of public worship, or of public justice" was left standing.  Rep. Willaim Claiborne again raised the radical Federalist argument that the measure to help fund the rebuilding of Savannah was constitutional under the general welfare clause.[5]  Reps. Nathaniel Macon[6], William Giles[7], Nicholas[8], and others argued that allocating federal funds to relieve Savannah would violate the Constitution, since such charity was not authorized by any enumerated power in the Constitution.  "Insurance offices," not the federal government, were "the proper securities against fire," according to Macon.[8]  Rep. Andrew Moore argued "every individual citizen could, if he pleased, show his individual humanity by subscribing to their relief, but it was not Constitutional for them to afford relief from the Treasury."[9]  The measure to provide relief to Savannah from federal tax dollars was then defeated 55-24 [10].[1] David P.

For many people, the often outlandish proposals and predictions of futurists are just obviously impractical and are to be laughed off.   This attitude, irrational is it may seem to futurists of the stripe who take outlandish ideas very seriously, is itself not to be sneered at -- automatic unbelievers in the alien save themselves from chasing many red herrings.  Those who laugh at futurism because they are unimaginative dolts I will not try to defend, but those who laugh at futurism when futurists take themselves too seriously are usually spot-on.  For those of a more serious nature and intellect who want to actually figure out the flaws in futuristic ideas, here are some heuristics:(1) Find the easier thing.   If there is an easier way to get much of the value from a proposal, ask yourself, why hasn't somebody pursued this easier way?    For example, seasteading proposes the creation of novel structures for people to settle permanentantly in the ocean.    Ask yourself, why don't there already exist communities that live permanently on cruise ships?  Why haven't oil companies moved the families of their offshore platform workers out to live where the work is?(2) Look to see if if the futurists have proposed experiments that can be done much sooner and more cheaply that would verify or falsify the propsosal or prediction.   Many of the "most important", in terms of perceived future impact, hyper-futuristic ideas are conveniently unfalsifiable: artificial intelligence, uploading of consciousness, and so on.  There are a near-infinite number of unfalsifiable theories that our imaginations could dream up,  making the odds of any given such theory to be true about zero.  The ability to conduct such dispositive experiments, the ability to prove a hypothesized event false if certain conditions occur, paradoxically makes that event far more likely.  A related heuristic is to be very leery of ideas that, as is said of fusion power, are "always thirty years in the future".   If the futurist can't explain why the futurist of 30 years ago who predicted something similar was wrong, that futurist should indeed be laughed at, early and often.  Far too many futurists are so futuristic that they know little about the past which they purport to be projecting.  Some don't even know when predictions similar to theirs were already made decades ago, and were already supposed to have come true.   At the same time, be wary of futurists who are not willing to make short-term predictions, lest we obtain a track record of the vast uncertainty involved in their brand of futurism.(3) Except for rare phenomena of high predictability, such as the orbits of planets, past performance does not guarantee future results.  Futurists often chart exponential curves of growth in some measure of technology: the speed of transport, the number of transistors that can fit on a chip, and so on.  The first half of a logistics curve looks much like an exponential curve.  You can fit an exponential curve to the data points, but it's really a logistic curve, which in the long run, and possibly even in the short run, will lead to a radically different kind of future.   Because of physical limits and human psychology, reality far more closely resembles logistic curves than exponential ones.  For example, world population growth seemed to follow an exponential curve until about the 1960s, when it flipped into a quite different mathematical regime.   This transition to sub-exponential growth started much sooner in the developed world, which should have been but was not a clue for the population alarmists.   As for physical limits, a good example is transport speed: it seemed to be growing exponentially until it hit the sound barrier in earth's atmosphere and the implacable nature of earth's gravity well beyond it in the latter half of the twentieth century.   More on the dubious nature of exponential projections here.(4) Beware of the prophets of false certainty.   These are people who focus on one out of many possible outcomes, or take very seriously unfalsifiable predictions, or follow exponential projections, or have neglected to find the easier thing, and pretend, because nobody has proven them wrong, that their version of the future has a high probability.  We have, for example, the Bayesiologists, who, while to their credit are at least aware of first-order uncertainty (known unknowns), neglect the higher-order uncertainties (unknown unknowns) inherent in most futurism and demand that we make some intuitive guess as to the numerical probability of their predicted event. (When asked for an intuitive numerical guess about some hyper-futuristic prediction, "50%, plus or minus 50%, distribution function unknown" is usually the best answer).(5) Look at interests.  You may not understand the science involved, but individual and institutional interests are human universals.  Take astrobiology, for example.  Here we have a science without a subject.  Now the astrobiologists to a man argue that extraterrestrial life must be common, indeed that it may well be right around the corner underneath the ice of Enceladus or Europa or on one of those exciting new exoplanets.  There appears to be, as many activists like to say about global warming, a "consensus" among the astrobiologists about the ubiquity of life in the universe.  But only primitive life, of course -- otherwise the uncomfortable fact that we have never observed the signs of any artificial surfaces, despite observing billions of stars in our own galaxy and billions of other galaxies, would rear its inconvenient head.  Thus the Rare Earth Hypothesis, in which for clever reasons life is supposed to almost always stops evolving beyond some primitive stage, in sharp contrast to the ongoing evolution of life to higher complexity in the only history of life we have actually observed.  Does the astrobiologists' consensus reflect their expertise and your ignorance in astronomical and biological matters, or does it reflect something else?  Consider this -- if you were skeptical about this astrobiological thesis, why would you become an astrobiologist in the first place, risking your career on a science that has no subject?  If the politicians and academic boards who fund them ever became convinced that extraterrestrial life probably does not exist anywhere where we will be able to observe it before they retire, astrobiologists would have to find new jobs.  This is a career for true believers.   Beyond this rather dramatic selection effect, we have individual and institutional self-interest to keep the argument going -- to fund their careers, astrobiologists must persuade us that life in universe is common, common enough that we should fund multibillion dollar telescopes and spacecraft and, of course, grant copious amounts of research funding to them in order to look for it within or astronomically very near our solar system, which is as far as we can observe the signs of primitive life.   Even if you know nothing whatsoever about either astronomy or biology,  but do understand a thing or to about humans, you are wise to be highly skeptical of the claims of astrobiologists.(6) Be especially skeptical of political futurism.   From NASA's Shuttle and Space Station, which were supposed to revolutionize space industry, to the politicization of doom-and-gloom scenarios such as overpopulation and the supposed dire consequences of global warming, politics mixed with futurism has a very poor track record.  By contrast, private entities like the Singularity Institute, Foresight Institute, and so forth, while even more outlandish and preposterously self-serious, can provide creative starting points for brainstorming towards more practical ideas and are relatively harmless.(That leads me to my last heuristic -- (7) avoid futurists who can't laugh at themselves).Futurism at its best is a creative and entertaining game of ideas.  Playing with outlandish ideas can be very productive -- for example, the Easier Thing on occasion may turn out to actually be a good idea you can implement now, and you arrive at the easier thing by starting with an outlandish idea.   I occasionally explore outlandish futuristic ideas here at Unenumerated, which prides itself on an unending variety of topics.  There is nothing to sneer at about futurism as fun unless you have an unimaginative rock for a brain.   However, those who take these ideas too seriously, or have created a false sense of certainty about them, do deserve a few guffaws.
This month has thrown off quite a bit of new information on Neanderthals and on the possibility that they interbred with some of the humans that came out of Africa. It's bound to stir up controversy.The first interesting recent study comes from extracting the remains of a probable Neanderthal DNA from 38,000 years ago, copying it into bacteria, and then sequencing it at leisure. (Query: do fundamentalists oppose this procedure as a forbidden "cloning of a human"?). This bacterial-Neanderthal chimera (actually, the Neanderthal genes are really just junk DNA from the point of view of the normally functioning bacteria) is an improvement over the traditional technique that apparently destroys the original DNA in the process of sequencing it. Preserving the DNA is vital for this application: Neanderthal DNA has been severely damaged by 38,000 years of chemistry and can only be obtained with severe difficulty in small fragments.Large-scale statistical studies from these probable Neanderthal sequences suggest that the number of genes we moderns derive from Neanderthals is few, if any. In other words, all of us trace either nearly all or entirely all of our ancestry from homo sapiens originating in Africa c. 200,000 years ago rather than to Neanderthals that originated some 700,000 years ago. Pretty much what most scientists have thought for the last few decades.However, that does not mean humans and Neanderthals didn't interbreed, and it doesn't mean that none of us got any important genes from them. There is some fossil evidence from Portugal and Romania suggesting human-Neanderthal hybrids. Even more startling is a study published this month showing that about 70% of modern humans possess a gene for brain development (this paper goes straight for the controversy jugular!) derived from an "archaic species of homo" rather than from our African homo sapiens ancestor. Since the time of "introgression" (cross-breeding between the archaic species and the African-derived modern species, homo sapiens) was about 37,000 years ago, and the gene is overly represented in Europe and Asia but uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa (I warned you about controversy!), it's a good guess that this gene was a "gift" from a sneaky Neanderthal to the second wave of modern humans to have left Africa, the ancestors of most modern Europeans and Asians. A gift that was positively selected -- it replaced its African-derived alternative almost everywhere they were in competition -- and with which most of us are now blessed. The Neanderthal DNA sequencing study shows that the African genes won the vast majority of the other competitions.
Science has revolutionized life since at least the age of exploration, through the industrial revolution, and to an unprecedented degree in the 20th century.  Science generally, and physics in particular, got a vast boost in credibility and in government funding following the ability of physicists to develop weapons of unprecedented power in the Manhattan Project.  Scientists and their engineering brethren also developed modern electronics, sent men and machines into the cosmos, and much else that would have seemed like miracles and prophecy in prior centuries. Sciences such as psychology and evolutionary theories of behavior have at least potentially revolutionaized our understanding of ourselves.  Now we have a large number of self-styled "social sciences" that attempt to understand social behavior and societies through scientific methods.  Instead of priests prophecying and invoking miraculous thunderbolts through mumbo-jumbo, our modern scientific priesthood helps create real technology and tells us what to think about social systems and political options by what seems to most people (and even to most scientists outside the particular specialty in question) equally mystical mumbo-jumbo.  This scientific elite is supposed to be all quite different from the priesthoods of old because it is supposed to adhere to scientific methods rather than superstition and dogma.  The scientific method developed from several sources, but one that is particularly interesting is the law of evidence in medieval and Renaissance Continental Europe.  In English law, issues of fact were (and are) determined by a jury and the law of evidence is all about the general biases of juries and thus what lawyers are and are not allowed to present as evidence to them -- the basic rule to overcome juror bias being that the relevance and integrity of the information must outweigh its potential to prejudice the jurors.  But in the neo-Roman law that dominated the Continent from the Late Middle Ages to this day, juries were rare and judges determined issues of fact as well as law.  Thus there developed in Continental law elaborate doctrines about how judges were supposed to weigh factual evidence.  Many Renaissance and Baroque era scientists, such as Galileo, Liebniz, and Pascal, had legal training and this Continental law of evidence was reflected in their methods.  Most other early scientists had been exposed to law-derived doctrines simply by attending universities many of whose doctrines derived from the original universities which were essentially law schools.  Soon, however, the scientific community was independently evolving its own cultural norms from this starting point.   The ideal was to seek the truth. Experiment became the sine quo non of scientific credibility, along with mathmetical rigor and important applications in navigation, engineering, and medicine.   Scientific funding came from a variety of sources; when governments funded scientists they were expected to solve important problems such as those raised by navigation of the seas, not merely to theorize.   After the Englightenment governments started to separate themselves from the social dogmas of their day -- religions -- by making secularizing government and allowing freedom of religion.Today a wide variety of important political issues are dominated by ideas from scienitific communities (or at least communities that style themselves as scientific): economists, climate scientists, and many others.  But there is no separation of science from government.   Like the state-sponsored religions of yore, most modern scientists derive both their education and their ongoing livelihood from government funding of the theories with which they are taught and on which they work.  The old state-sponsored religions, and the resulting ideas about politics and society, were funded by governments.  Not surprisingly, as such governments took over religion it became sacreligious to criticize the importance of government generally and often specific governmental institutions in particular.  Under the nationalizers of dogma such as Henry VIII, who nationalized the lands and priests of the Catholic Church in England, "render under Caeasar" became more important than "render under God."  Despite the advantages of better funding these state-sponsored sects have been in decline ever since governments stopped otherwise suppressing their competitors.   The state sponsored churches mostly taught uncritical worship of authority whereas their private competitors added much more spiritual value to their adherent's lives.  The simplest science is physics.   In some sense all other sciences are just a variety of complex models of what happens when various kinds of complex physical systems interact.   Physics itself is the simple core of science.  Thus physics has been hailed as the "hardest" of the "hard sciences" -- sciences where evidence trumps bias and the truth always outs sooner or later, usually sooner, despite the biases of the individuals or institutions involved.  Hard scientists will often admit that the  use of the scientific method in "soft sciences" such as economics and other intersubjective areas can be problematic and subject to great bias.   If any science can rise above self-serving biases and efficiently search for the truth, it should be physics. But the recent history of physics casts some rather disturbing shadows on the integrity of even this hardest of sciences.  Lee Smolin in The Trouble with Physics lays out a picture of an unprecedented group of geniuses, the string theorists, who have wasted the last twenty years, largely at taxpayer's expense, basically producing nothing except a vast number of highly obscure but, in certain senses, quite elegant theories.  The number of possible string theories is so vast that string theory can, like "intelligent design," explain anything -- it is unfalsifiable.  It is "not even wrong," to take Wolfgang Pauli's phrase about an earlier unfalsifiable theory of his era.  String theory's main rivals over the last two decades are not much better. Theoretical physics for the last twenty years has mostly not been science at all, but rather has been a large group of geniuses working on their own cabalistic variety of sudoku puzzles at taxpayer expense in the name of science.If this is the state of physics -- if even the hardest of sciences can be taken over by a thousand-strong cabal of geniuses who produce nothing of value except wonderful-sounding untestable theories whose main success has been in garnering their community more of our tax dollars -- what hope do we have that government-funded climate scientists, economists, and others purporting to do science in areas far more complex or subjective than physics are actually producing relatively unbiased truths?  If we took a poll of theoretical physicists, they might well have (up until quite recently) reached a remarkable degree of "consensus" on the truth of string theory -- just as global warming scientists have reached a "consensus" on global warming and (it is implied) on the various bits of the speculative nonsense surrounding global warming.  Does such consensus mean us lay people should automatically believe this consensus of experts?  Or should we demand more?  Shouldn't we rather, when deciding on which theories or predictions of climate science or economics to believe, act like a Continental judge or a common-law jury and demand to actually see the evidence and weigh it for ourselves?  Shouldn't we demand to hear from the defense as well as from the prosecution?  Experiment, multiple points of view, and critical analysis are, after all, the real scientific method -- as opposed to the ancient religious method of uncritically trusting a single hierarchy of experts.  Today's ideas about politics and society -- "scientific theories" if you agree with them, "dogmas" if you don't -- are funded by the very governmental entities that stand to benefit from increased government power.  Just as it was taboo under Henry VIII to "deny" the authority of either Christ or the King, it has now become taboo in many of these modern intellectual communities to "deny" a variety of scientific theories that are now supposed to be "beyond debate," not just things like the basic idea of global warming caused at least in part by anthropogenic carbon dioxide(which this author finds sound and quite probable, but nevertheless believes should remain like all true scientific theories open to further inquiry and debate) but also the variety of extreme speculations that have grown up around it (regarding the severity of storms, projections of droughts, floods, etc., most of which are pseudoscientific nonsense).  I'm hardly the only person who recognizes this problem with science.  Indeed, the opinion expressed above is quite mild compared to an increasing number of conservatives who are coming to reject big chunks of good science along with the bad -- not just the many florid speculations surrounding global warming, but global warming itself, evolution, and other products of the expert priesthood that threaten long-established (and often, ironically, highly evolved) beliefs.   Conservatives, and more than a few libertarians, feel that modern science is becoming increasingly dominated by government funding and thus becoming dominated by the interests of government in gaining more dominance over our lives.   With opposing ideas increasingly unable to access to this research and education funding themselves, the easiest way for those opposed to increasing state power to effectuate their beliefs is to reject the theories of the scientific communities that promote this power.This, and not sheer cave-man irrationality, is why many conservatives are increasingly throwing out the baby with the bathwater and rejecting science generally.  Both trends -- the increased government dominance over science and the increasing rejection of science generally by those who oppose increased government controls which scientists increasingly promote -- are disturbing and dangerous.  Science, once a method of weighing evidence that called for the opinions of both prosecution and defense, is increangly being dominated by the prosecution.   We need a return to science with a diversity of funding and thus a diversity of biases.  This is much more important to the health of science than the absolute level of funding of science.  Reducing government funding of science would thus increase the quality of science -- by making the biases of scientific communities more balanced and thus more likely to cancel each other out, just as the biases of the defense generally cancel out the biases of the prosecution.  Where government does fund science, it should demand strict compliance to the basic evidentiary principles of science, such as falsifiability.  All government-funded theorists should be required to design experiments that can be conducted relatively inexpensively and in the near future, that would strongly tend to verify or falsify their proposed theories.  More speculative theories -- such as those that rely on unobserved or worse, unobservable entities -- simply should not be funded by governments.  There are a wide variety of private entities that are happy to fund such speculations; this variety of funding sources is more important to reducing bias the further one gets away from strictly controlled experiment.  Any time government funds science we should ask, does the utility of the potential discoveries and the integrity of the scientific methods being used -- their ability to find the truth even in the face of high institutional bias -- outweigh the potential for the funding by one dominant source to prejudice the opinions of the fund recipients?  Science has benefited our lives in incalculable ways for many centuries.  Increasingly we inform our political decisions with the discoveries and theories of science. As sciences ranging from climatology to economics play an increasing role modern politics, this task of building a wall of separation between government and science -- or at least not allowing states to sponsor particular scientific theories at the expense of others with comparable weights of evidence, and not allowing states to fund some biased speculations at the expense of others -- is one of our most important and urgent tasks.   If we are to remain living in democracies we voters must learn once again to weigh some of the evidence for ourselves, even if this means we gain our understanding through the lossy communications of popularizers.  It does not work to trust a theory, no matter how scientific it may sound, based on a "consensus" or "lack of debate" among experts who mostly derive their funding from a single biased source.  We democratic jurors must demand to hear from the defense -- really from a variety of parties whose biases largely cancel each other out -- rather than from just the prosection.  We must redesign our scientific institutions to minimize the biases that come from a single dominant source of funding if we are to achieve good solutions to our important problems -- solutions that are not dominated by the biases of that dominant entity.
What do antiques, time, and gold have in common?  They are costly, due either to their original cost or the improbability of their history, and it is difficult to spoof this costliness.  For example, it is usually difficult to spend an extra hour at the office without sacrificing about an hour of your personal life.Unforgeable costliness is a pattern that recurs in many human institutions and is fundamental to civilization.   Modern employment is based on the time-rate wage.  Our monetary system is based on money being made unforgeably costly either through collectibles, commodity standards, or (in modern fiat currencies) accounting.  The unforgeable costliness pattern includes the following basic steps:(1) find or create a class of objects that is highly improbable, takes much effort to make, or both, and such that the measure of their costliness can be verified by other parties.(2) use the objects to enable a protocol or institution to cross trust boundariesThere are some problems involved with implementing unforgeable costliness on a computer.   If such problems can be overcome, we can achieve bit gold.  This would be the first online currency based on highly distributed trust and unforgeable costliness rather than trust in a single entity and traditional accounting controls.   Hal Finney has implemented a variant of bit gold based on a tamper-evident computer plug-in card, for which remote users can verify what code is running on the card.
If you leave from or arrive into at least the 4th, 5th, or 9th Circuits (see map), your laptop can be searched at will, reports Orin Kerr, yet another talented law prof at my alma mater. This incident in Canada also involved a laptop scan as well as interrogation into possible libertarian sympathies. Of course, the scan of your laptop need not be restricted to child porn. Until we get the Fourth Amendment back, you can get some of its effect back by using TrueCrypt. Or just improve your odds of privacy by leaving the laptop at home and using something less conspicuous.
"The blogosphere has developed a set of copyright norms in an area where there is very little enforcement. These norms about the use of copyrighted material are probably at odds with existing copyright law."  So writes Daniel Solove, a professor at my law school,  More here (via Emergent Chaos).  The same was true of the original Internet itself (e-mail, ftp, and so on), and then of the web.  There would be no useful Internet and no useful web if it the copyright that copyright law says exists in almost every human-generated packet of bits was actually tracked and enforced.  Copyright exists by default, simply from the human act of creating a web page, a photo, some music, and so on.  Generally, under current copyright law once a work is created it may not be copied without the express permission of the copyright owner.  However, if this standard were actually applied to the Internet transaction costs would be prohibitive and the Internet would not usefully exist.Fortunately, at least some of the massive copying done by the Internet has been deemed to come under "implied consent."  By sending e-mail or publishing your web page, you have given implied consent for intermediating servers and users to have their software make copies so that users can view your work.  Unless you put up a "robots.txt" file that forbids it, presumably Google and other search engines are free to copy, search, and cache your web pages, without asking you despite your copyright in them.  Contrary to standard copyright law, web searching like many other features of the Internet does not require the express permission of the copyright owner.  To be protected against copying the author must give notice that he desires such protection, rather than the starting with the presumption that nothing can be copied.  This results in radically lower transaction costs that make e-mail, the web, and web searching possible.  But when an industry fights back (e.g. the music industry against P2P) the presumptions made by emerging Internet norms can be put in jeopardy, Solove points out.The idea that copyright exists by default in a work is a rather recent one, especially in the United States.  Traditionally, unless one registered the work with a copyright office, or at least labeled the work as "copyright", it was presumed that the work was placed, like almost all human communication has traditionally been placed, in the public domain.  Copyright offices are now online and works mostly digital, so that registration can be made far easier.  It's often easy to give notice to software regarding the status of works as with the "robots.txt" system.  Under Internet norms works such as e-mails, web pages, and blog posts are not protected against copying by default.  Thus, this older version of copyright law, where works are not copyrighted until they are registered or at least labeled as such (this time in a computer-readable way) is what we should return to in the Internet era, legally as well as de facto.
Not two days after I observed that the United States gives litigants intrusive discovery and subpoena powers, the Justice Department provides a good example.  In pursuit of its case defending the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) in ACLU v. Gonzales that Department has commanded, via a  subpoena for production of evidence, various search engines that are not parties to the suit (Google, Yahoo, etc.) to hand over very large samples of URLs available to be searched and search queries from you and me.  For example, it commanded Google to hand over all "URL's" available to be searched "as of July 31, 2005" and and all queries performed on their search engines between June 1 and July 31st of 2005.   Fortunately, the subpoenas have not asked for information that might identify the querier (besides the query itself, which identifies all us "ego surfers" who like to keep track of what people are saying about us).  Thus, it has not asked for your Internet protocol addresss that search engines could and probably routinely do record, or cookies which also can be used to tie together different searches that you have made.   Perhaps the DoJ is just looking to make a statistical study to justify the law, for example that some fraction of Internet searches are for porn.  They may argue that if porn is available to a search engine, then it is effectively available to minors.   According to Professor Orin Kerr, the DoJ is arguing that COPA requires password protection for pornography, not just filters: "DOJ's argument is that it needs the information from Google to explain the role of search engines in locating and obtaining pornography, which is then integral to understanding why filters are not an effective alternative to COPA screens [i.e., password protection]."  However, unless the data is securely protected by the procedures (archaically designed for paper documents) specified in the protective order, the DoJ could use this data for a wide variety of surveillance unrelated to porn and COPA.  Here's a declaration that includes the subpoena, Google's response, and the protective order.  Whereas MSN, AOL, and Yahoo complied with the subpoena (after apparently negotiating to reduce the amount of data), Google has objected to the subpoena.  Good for Google!  Powers to intrude on new kinds of privately collected data should never be given to a government without challenge, except where absolutely necessary in a truly urgent emergency, which this surely is not.  (In other words, if this was September 12 and DoJ was asking airline web sites to hand over search queries for trips by plane to the East Coast the morning of the 11th, I'd expect Google to be patriotic and comply.  Short of that kind of very rare and very urgent extremity, I expect and am happy to see them be patriotic and resist).   If the Department of Justice wants Google's records, it will now have to ask the court to compel production under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 45(c)(2)(B).I hope the federal court allows the ACLU to examine that kind and volume of data in its discovery of the NSA.  Much more likely is that the Department of Justice is going to invoke national security to set up a very big double standard when it comes to discovery.  The NSA can argue that protective orders designed for paper are woefully inadequate for protecting top secret digital data.  Alas, they'd be right, even if it were just commercial trade secret data.  Our law firms need and our courts should require 21st century security techniques for protection of discovered or subpoenaed digital evidence.  We could, for example, use key splitting techniques and require that discovery be done on tamper-evident court computers with the evidence owner and a court official present.  We might also in the future use multiparty secure computation for studies of the kind the DOJ, the ACLU, the FISA court, and so on would like to perform on sensitive digital data.Given federal discovery rules, PATRIOT, FISA, and the unchecked and infinite power claimed by the executive branch, the sad fact as things stand now is that the feds claim the right to snoop on us almost at will.  Indeed, the Justice Department is currently arguing that they have a perfect right to snoop on any aspect of our lives, whether we consider said aspect to be private or not, at will, if at their sole discretion they believe it is relevant to national security.  But despite the supposed even-handedness of federal discovery rules, the federal government is going to declare that, when they get sensitive about it, we have very little right to check up on them.   Since when do "public servants" get to conduct surveillance on "we the people" and not vice versa?
I'm writing a book on the history of commercial institutions.   I've broken down a section on the birth of insurance into a separate article.   It highlights an early marine insurance contract and discusses Santera's pioneering work on the law and economics of risk.
Just off the cost of New Guinea, Melanesians evolved (over thousands, and perhaps even tens of thousands, of years) a unique commercial institution known as the "kula ring" for the collectibles that circulated within it. The unforgeably scarce kula collectibles doubled as "high power" money and mnemonic for stories and gossip. Many of the goods traded, mostly agricultural products, were available in different seasons, and so could not be traded in kind. Kula collectibles solved this double-coincidence problem as an unforgeabaly costly, wearable (for security), and circulated (literally!) money. Necklaces circulated clockwise, and armshells counter-clockwise, in a very regular pattern. By solving the double-coincidence problem an armshell or necklace would prove more valuable than its cost after only a few trades, but could circulate for decades. Gossip and stories that about prior owners of the collectibles further provided information about upstream credit and liquidity. In other Neolithic cultures collectibles, usually shells, circulated in a less regular pattern but had similar purposes and attributes. 
In the comments section of yet another economics professor's blog, Devin Finbarr makes some excellent observations regarding the collectible nature of most investment assets, starting with this nice classification:There are only three types of goods in an economy:1) goods providing direct utility ( a car, tv, chocolate )2) collectibles ( a baseball card, diamonds, gold )3) flows ( stocks, bonds )The demand for every investment asset -- stocks, housing, commodities, etc. -- is a function of some combination of these factors.  In housing all three demand factors are at work. Every asset that is not just a fixed monetary cash flow has a collectible premium that reflects, when rational, inflation expectations.  (n.b. this is technical nomenclature that can have a slightly different meaning than the normal use of the words -- for example I, and presumably Devin, classify the enjoyment one can get from collecting baseball cards or wearing gold jewelry as part of their "utility" rather than their "collectible" nature, the latter being purely a matter of the asset's perceived or actual function as a store of value or medium of exchange).It is often very difficult to guess what the factors of demand coming from direct consumption utility are (for example, is the sunny yet cool California coast and the wealthy and smart neighbors it attracts worth paying five times as much or is the coastal California price premium, as Devin suggests, primarily a collectible premium?).  Sometimes it's also difficult to estimate cash flow.  Thus  it's often hard to estimate the collectible premium.  Also, since the collectible (or inflation expectations) premium is little recognized, a wide variety of bogus explanations are often used to explain price movements that are actually due to changing inflation expectations: the most popular being dubious theories of changes in supply (e.g. "peak oil") or consumption demand, since demand for assets as inflation hedges is very under-recognized.  Also common are theories that impute price changes due to changes in inflation expectations to purely irrational psychology,  "technical", or "trend" factors based on the history of the price itself.   (The history of housing prices from 1940 to 2005 made houses look like a lucrative and low-risk investment, for example).Devin describes inflation expectations as causing a hunt for stores of value in which packs of investors irrationally change their focus from one market to another, causes bubbles and bursts.  Since the collectible premium is often so hard to estimate, and is so little recognized, and so many investors do despite those warnings you hear invest based solely on past price history, I don't substantially disagree with this:A stock market is in disequilibrium when people start trading stocks as collectibles rather than as flows. In other words, instead of buying a stock based on the hope of generating a return via dividends, they start buying a stock in order to sell it to someone else ( price appreciation)....When the government dilutes the money supply, people start searching for a replacement collectible to serve as a store of value. People end up buying stocks not based on dividend yields, but in order to trade for later at a higher dollar price. People buy houses not based on direct utility or as an alternative to paying rent, but in order to sell for later at a higher price. These goods start trading as collectibles, and thus are subject to the whims of the herd.In short, if long-term inflation expectations were zero, the prices of housing, stocks, commodities, etc. could be estimated from demand deriving solely from their cash flow plus consumption demand -- there would be no collectible premium.  But since asset prices come with a difficult to estimate and fluctuating inflation expectations premium, this makes it far harder to judge whether an asset is over- or under-priced, leading to greater over- and under-pricing, i.e. seemingly irrational asset booms and busts. A couple of caveats:(1) It's important to observe in the context of stocks that their cash flows can come from share buybacks and takeovers as well as dividends, so even with zero inflation expectations people would rationally invest partly for expected price rises in addition to dividends.(2) There are a number of other sources of high uncertainty in asset markets, e.g. uncertainty over credit conditions, so that bubbles and bursts would not completely go away with zero inflation expectations.  However the contribution of changing inflation expectations has, I believe, been the largest factor in most asset price movements since the 1970s.Bubbles and bursts are based on high degrees of uncertainty about the future far more than on genuine mass irrationality.   Of course, things like the Internet bubble seem quite irrational in hindsight, but if you keep in mind what was going on in the late 1990s -- a huge increase in subjective value due to new (to the vast majority of investors) Internet services such as e-mail, Web, search engines, and on-line price quotes -- it was not, without hindsight, terribly irrational to suppose that most of this value would be monetized as profit for the innovating companies.  It turned out to be mostly unmonetized -- instead we got most of the foregoing plus shared music, Wikipedia, blogs, and other things of great value for almost free -- so that the Internet bubble collapsed and seems irrational in hindsight. Bubbles and bursts due to uncertainty over technological innovation will undoubtedly occur again, but the greatest ongoing source of uncertainty in our markets is not regarding technology and monetization of innovation, but rather uncertainties about currencies, credit, globalization, and related political factors, out of which the uncertainty over currencies is usually the greatest.My takes on last summer's commodity hysteria as it was happening can be found via here.Devin has put these theories to good use:since inflation helps build the bubble, even a small amount of deflation can cause rapid price collapses. The fall in price will be much greater than the fall in dividends. Late last summer I was looking at numbers, and noticed that real estate, equities, oil, and gold had all been down for two months straight. The only thing those goods have in common is the currency they are priced in. So I said, “Holy deflation, Batman!” and sold half of the index funds that I owned.I congratulate Devin and I do like the strategy suggested here, i.e. arbitrage between asset markets with irrationally different collectible premiums.  This strategy does, however, assume that one can estimate the price derived from just supply and cash flow plus consumption demand, at least enough to be able to determine that there is a substantial collectible premium.That said, I'd add (perhaps disagreeing with Devin) that in the large collapse in commodities since last summer, decreased expectations for future industrial consumption (due to rising expectations of a long-term worldwide recession) and probably a change in the rationality of the collectible premium of commodities were also major factors alongside the decrease in inflation expectations.   Thus gold did not fall nearly as much as the industrial commodities.  (It's also possible that this reflects some sort of security premium in a crisis of gold over other commodities, but despite all the gold coin ads to this effect I'm skeptical about that being a large factor). Of course, a change in consumption expectations will also tend to make stocks go down, due to the more direct cause of decreased profits leading to decreased cash flows from dividends etc.   Commodities markets reflected informed expectations about future inflation and consumption more quickly than stocks, giving Devin his signal.  Gold and commodities prices have a good long-term correlation across business cycles.  Industrial mineral prices do tend to vary more than gold within a business cycle due to changes in consumption expectation.  (Of course these are not really predictable "cycles", but unpredictable effects of things like credit conditions, but "business cycle" is the unfortunate standard term in economics for this variation in overall credit and consumption).  Another example of the collectible premium arbitrage strategy is to look at the oil/gold price ratio.  Last summer this ratio was far too high (in hindsight, although at the time I was skeptical that this unprecedented ratio would last), reflecting a very high valuation of industrial commodities as collectibles.  Recently it has much lower, reflecting much lower valuation as collectibles (probably irrationally too low), as well as lowered consumption expectations (the business cycle).  In both cases one would have profited over the course of entire business cycle (and even in these two cases, luckily, over the short run) from betting against even more extreme deviations from the average historical ratio (or historical trend -- it's certainly plausible that oil and some other industrial minerals are being depleted faster than gold, or that there are long-term secular difference in their demand functions, but as the recent oil/gold ratio collapse to 1980 levels suggests, the secular depletion/demand gap between oil and gold is probably quite small, and almost certainly less than 2% per year over the long run).
Yes, I do, I say readily.   Of course, I'm not being interrogated after losing an iPod down an airplane toilet.  I'm not normally a big fan of FDR, but "we have nothing to fear but fear itself" seems rather apropos.
A paradox is usually just a good reductio ad absurdum, or what mathematicians call a proof by contradiction.   The paradox serves to disprove one of its assumptions (or equivalently, if we "exclude the middle", to prove the opposite of one of its assumptions).   Many intellectuals often overly complicate paradoxes, for the sake of entertainment or out of wishful thinking that the dubious assumption has not in fact been disproven.  A paradox is only truly mysterious if more than one of the assumptions being used are truly mysterious, and thus we can't tell which assumption caused the contradiction.  But usually it's more a case of obsfucation or wishful thinking than of genuine mystery.   Many academics have a terrible habit of hiding or confusing their assumptions, and this allows wishful thinking to run rampant.Newcomb's paradox Chooser -- let's say that's you --- plays a game wherein you choose whether to open both boxes A and B or just B.  For whatever odd reason --  Predictor is an omniscient diety, Predictor is running a very repeatable simulation of the Chooser's mind, time travel, the Predictor has repeatedly run the Chooser through this experiment before, etc. -- the Predictor already knows with very high probability what box(es) the Chooser will select.   The first step in the game is that the Predictor makes his prediction.  Then a trustworthy third party puts $1,000 into box A, and $1,000,000 into box B if the Predictor has predicted B only, otherwise nothing into box B.  After these two steps are completed the Chooser selects which box(es) to open.Here's the payoff matrix for Chooser:Predicted choiceActual choicePayoffA and BA and B$1,000A and BB only$0B onlyA and B$1,001,000B onlyB only$1,000,000What is Chooser's best strategy?  According to game theory, A and B beats B-only by $1,000 whether the Predictor predicts A and B or just B.  Therefore Chooser should choose to open both A and B.But another strategy for Chooser is the following: The Chooser, knowing that the Predictor has very good information about his forthcoming choice and has mechanically acted on it, and thus is almost surely correct, eliminates those choices where the Predictor is wrong and chooses B-only over A and B because of the remaining two choices it has a higher payoff.By following 2-player game theory, the expected value of Chooser's winnings is only a bit over $1,000, while by taking into account the high accuracy of the Predictor's prediction and maximizing expected value the expected value is a bit over $1,000,000.The paradox dissappears if you stop assuming a game with two players.   The Predictor does not have any stake in the outcome and is not a player.  Indeed, we are told that Predictor will make no free choice at all, but will simply mechanically predict what Chooser will do.   It's the Chooser's free will in the face of a mechanical but oddly well-informed Predictor.   Chooser should not be misled by the payoff matrix into assuming this is a 2-player game, but should instead choose the best of the two choices of significant probability.Fermi's ParadoxEnrico Fermi asked, if there are extraterrestrial civilizations, why haven't we seen them?  No alien artifacts large or small on earth, nor anything visibly unnatural on the many millions of square kilometers of billion-year-old (or more) surface we've observed elsewhere in our solar system, nor any visible megastructures in our galaxy.   Under Darwinian evolution life and civilization tends to spread to use as much energy and matter as it can.   New volcanic islands and areas where life has been destroyed by volcanoes are quickly colonized by a very observable spread of plants that soon soak up a significant fraction of the incoming sunlight.  Human civilizations have similarly in the blink of astronomical time spread all over our planet, leaving a number of highly visible artifacts such as the Great Wall of China, a dazzling display of lights on the night side of our planet, and in our atmosphere increased carbon dioxide and a potpouri of odd chemicals.  Photosynthetic life has given our planet a bizarre oxygen atmosphere and turned our continents significantly darker.  Even if an alien society somehow turned radically un-Darwinian and thus remained obsessively small and hidden, it would take just one "crazy hermit" to appear once in hundreds of millions of years to take off and replicate his crazy Darwinian verion of that civilization across the galaxy, building visible structures all over the galaxy to efficiently use stellar energy and recycle volatile elements.  The average star in our galaxy is about 10 billion years old; if it takes 5 billion years for life to appear and evolve into a civilization and 200 million years for the their descendants to spread across our galaxy (which only requires travel at a small fraction of the speed of light), the average civilization that has already emerged in our galaxy should have spread across it 2.3 billion years ago.   If they exist, or existed, evidence of this existence should be all over the galaxy, just as with the existence of life and civilization on earth.  But we see no evidence that any advanced civilization has ever expanded into our solar system or any where else in our galaxy.  Even worse, we see no evidence of artificiality in other galaxies.  Artificial entities would severely change what we observe in the cosmos, but instead the millions of galaxies we've observed seem to look quite natural.  This can be easily tested by studying data from our current telescopes.  Unless we discover a significant proportion of galaxies that are oddly dim in the optical but bright in the infrared (or perhaps, if the alien machines are extremely clever and very miserly, in the microwave), indicating artificially efficient use of stellar energy, and oddly bright in the heavy element spectra and dim in the volatile elements spectra, indicating artifically efficient enclosure of the volatile elements (for efficient volatile recycling), we must conclude that the odds of finding a civilization in any given galaxy, and thus of another civilization in our own galaxy, are remote.  Fermi's paradox simply proves its major assumption wrong: there are no little green men in our galaxy.  Sorry to pop that good old sense of wonder.   It would be fun to listen in on a civilization from a distant galaxy, if we ever find one and if we ever figure out how to detect such faint signals.   Imagine the Wikipedia of a billion-year-old civilization!Kavka's toxinPerhaps less easily resolved, because one of its assumptions is the vague and subjective idea of "intent", is the paradox of Gregory Kavka's toxin: you get $1 million put in your bank account at 9 AM if at 7 AM you intend to drink an extremely painful but not otherwise harmful toxin at 11 AM.   The toxin basically causes you to live in sheer hell for 24 hours. You get to keep the million dollars whether you drink the toxin or not.  Can you intend to do something that when the time comes would not be rational to do?  Kavka says you can't -- that there is no way to win the $1 million.  Turn off your alarm and sleep in.My analysis is that the only ways to win the $1 million are through credible commitment or self-delusion.  Thus the Wikipedia entry cites election-year political promises that would actually be too expensive to implement as an example of Kavka's toxin.  Of course the political party only fools others (and perhaps themselves) into believing its intent.   Standard election procedures, in which campaign promises are not legally binding, prevent credible commitment, so serious intent only could arise through self-delusion.
The University of Oregon is recreating a famous Roman sundial from 10 B.C. which doubled as a clock and calendar.  A few decades earlier the Roman comic writer Plautus put into the mouth of an idle character a complaint against shared standards of time and scheduling:            “The gods confound the man who first found out            How to distinguish the hours.  Confound him too,            Who in this place set up a sundial,            To cut and hack my days so wretchedly            Into small pieces!  When I was a boy,            My belly was my sundial – only surer,            Truer, and more exact than any of them.            This dial told me when ‘twas the proper time            To go to dinner, when I ought to eat;            But nowadays, why even when I have,            I can’t fall to unless the sun gives leave.            The town’s so full of these confounded dials!”As I described my article "A Measure of Sacrifice,"  the Romans recognized astronomical time as a measure of sacrifice, but it was the medieval bell and clock makers who gave us our modern sense of precise shared time.  Precise and objectively measured time used as measure of sacrifice is one of the patterns of integrity basic to modern civilization.  I describe some of the latest research in securely sharing time and determining the order of events on the Internet in "Advances in Distributed Security."
Unenumerated is going into reruns season.  For the next few weeks I will be reposting the best articles from this blog.  These will mostly be posts from previous years, so unless you have been a reader since the beginning or have read most of the archives many of these will be new to you.  Most blogs discuss the news or similar ephemera and for them reruns would be silly, but this blog mostly discusses issues of historical or otherwise long-term importance, and I will only be rerunning those kinds of articles.  If you haven't read a particular old article from Unenumerated yet it will be as informative and entertaining today as when it was first posted. I will probably have "theme weeks" where this blog will run several classic articles on a particular theme (jurisdiction, legal/political procedure, property, contracts, money, traditional security, online security protocols, media, etc.).
Libertarians have long observed with regret the radical expansion of the power of the United States federal government over its original scope under the Constitution of 1789. Lovers of freedom tend to blame two chief culprits for this expansion: President Abraham Lincoln, who instigated our Civil War, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt with his New Deal. And indeed, these Presidents did instigate some noxious precedents: Abraham Lincoln the draft and income tax, FDR the advocacy of positive substantive rights and the birth of practically unlimited regulatory power of federal government. Some cite villains from the Progressive Era, such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.However, these theories oversimplify U.S. history to the point where the real and fixable sources of our loss of freedom cannot be identified. They make it sound like if we could simply go back in history and remove a handful of powerful villains, or avoid a handful of crises, then we would be living in a much freer society today. That is very far from the reality.The consequences of even Lincoln and FDR were not unmixed. Lincoln damaged some freedoms, but he also greatly increased freedom by ending slavery. The Civil War Amendments, especially the 14th Amendment, eventually led to a great increase in the enforcement of unenumerated rights (hence the name of this blog!) and the Bill of Rights against the states (and, for reasons I relate here, hence also against the federal government). Among the leading countries in the middle of the evil 20th century, the United States despite FDR was the most free. FDR destroyed the threat of fascism and appointed most of the Justices who ended forced and unequal segregation by race. One can easily argue, especially in the case of FDR, that the curses outweighed the blessings, but one cannot seriously portray even these powerful Presidents as unmixed enemies of freedom. It's great fun, and may be morally imperative, to blaspheme these great gods in the pantheon of government worship, but criticisms of these particular actors don't get us to the core of why, in the face of a Constitution that outline a strictly enumerated set of powers, the adherents of that religion were able burst far beyond those bounds and render them nugatory.The expansion of power of the U.S. federal government was not primarily due to villians, crises, or revolutions, but far more resembled the proverbial boiling frog: it mostly happened by small and obscure steps that were not widely noted by lovers of freedom at the time, and have seldom been noted by us since. The slow rot of Constitutional protections against federal power stemmed from subtle but endemic flaws in the original frame of our federal government, the rise of an economy where large numbers of people earned income from auditable corporations (making the income tax, the most lucrative tax in history, practical), and the disappearance of frontiers of free land to which the overtaxed or overregulated could flee. This article focuses primarily on the first, the clearest and most fixable cause, the procedural flaws in our Constitution.The U.S. Constitution lists a number of enumerated powers, beyond which Congress was granted no power to legislate. In other words, the U.S. Congress was supposed to have a small, close-ended list of powers, and this is still recognized by the Supreme Court as theoretically true today. If this had remained true in practice, as well as legal theory, the U.S. federal government would be a radically libertarian entity today. That it is no longer practically true, is, more than any other factor, due to the long series of usurpations of power by Congress under the Commerce Clause, which in its words gives the Congress the power to regulate “commerce among the States.” At the time, this power was thought to be limited to power to regulate the transport of goods and persons across State boundaries, and indeed in the first century of the Constitution it was largely in practical fact so limited. (There are a number of other causes, such as the 16th Amendment of 1913 legalizing the income tax, but the Commerce Clause is the way in which Congress has most expanded its power to regulated, and an extremely vast expansion it has been).It’s fairly obvious why Congress, by itself, has not and would not seriously let any kind of Constitutional text limit its own power. Less obvious is why the Supreme Court, which has the final word on interpreting Congressional power to legislate under the Constitution, would allow Congress to so greatly expand its powers. But that is just what it did, by many slow and incremental steps.Under Chief Justice Marshall, there were a number of cases restricting the power of States to regulate what Marshall argued was interstate commerce, and thus under federal jurisdiction. In immediate effect these were libertarian decisions, since they overturned often burdensome State laws. The Marshall Court, and the Story Court that followed it, refused to find, even once, any limits on the federal Commerce Clause power. Although it was generally agreed that “commerce among the States” was limited to the transport of goods and persons across state lines, Marshall refused to define it in this manner, or indeed define any clear outer limited to the Commerce power. Indeed, in dicta (sentences in a legal opinion that are not legally binding, because they are not logically necessary for reaching the verdict), Marshall suggested that any activity that “effects” such transport might be regulated. Although Marshall’s nationalist ideology set the tone, overturning state laws and ignoring federal laws, this pattern of limiting state usurpations but ignoring federal usurpations was largely continued by future courts, for reasons of bias or conflicts of interest caused by court selection and structure which I describe here.Although there were a handful of cases limiting the Commerce Clause in very narrow and specific ways at the end of the 19th century, the Swift v. U.S. case in 1905 greatly expanded the Clause’s scope to cover manufacturing, not just the transport of goods or persons across State borders, on the theory that the manufactured goods would end up in interstate commerce. This was part of the so-called “Progressive” movement, the rise of the modern religion of "the government", an omnipotent deity called upon by the national press to solve any major problem deemed to be national in scope. This era saw the greatest expansions of federal power in U.S. history, including its basic tools of financial power, the Federal Reserve system and the 16th Amendment in 1913 legalizing the income tax. During this era, in which states also greatly expanded their powers, the Supreme Court was again far more active at limiting the states than limiting federal power. The “Progressive Era” was a very broad and general ideological movement, and most of it cannot be pinned on any particular politician. Drivers of the movement included the steam press and news wire agencies, which promulgated a national view (that vague godlike phrase, “the government”, came to refer to the federal rather than state government during this era). Under this new media system information transfer became dominated by the press releases of powerful governments and corporations. The spread of government-mandated education, again inculcating a very nationalist view, in the latter half of the 19th century also played a large role. The end of free arable land on the Western frontier and the rise of the auditable corporation also played crucial roles in facilitating much greater levels of taxation. During this era, except for a handful of minor victories, the federal courts did not prevent Congress and the President under the impetus of this movement from usurping vast powers not granted them under the original meaning of the Constitution.After this, the New Deal simply delivered the coup de grace. In Wickard v. Fillburn, the Court proved it had no desire to limit the federal government in any serious way, using Marshall’s “effects” dicta to justify its holding that growing wheat on your own small farm for your own consumption is “commerce among the States." Quite recently, the Supreme Court reconfirmed this absurdity: growing marijuana in your house is also “commerce among the States.” And thus the frog has been boiled. To this day our amphibian does not realize that it has already been cooked. The idea that the U.S. Supreme Court, given this long history of precedents, and the same kinds of selectional and operational biases it has always operated under, will ever seriously limit federal power again, just because that is what the Constitution says it must do, is far-fetched. Our courts as currently structured will only protect certain narrow rights of persons under the Bill of Rights from otherwise omnipotent governments. The idea that “We the People” will somehow elect a Congress or President that will voluntarily waive their own powers is even more absurd. Libertarians are playing a game with a very stacked deck, and that deck is stacked by the Constitution itself, the very same Constitution that in its original meaning was, substantively, radically libertarian, but that included procedural incentives for Congress and the Courts to slowly aggrandize federal powers.Labels: Commerce Clause, Constitution, federal, libertarian, United States

Hampton Sides' book Blood and Thunder is a detailed and colorful account of the Western frontier in the United States around the mid-19th century, mostly from the Mexican War to the Civil War.  It is half biography of the trapper, guide, and soldier Kit Carson, who participated in a wide variety of interesting and important events, and half general history, mostly of what is now the Southwestern U.S. and much of that in New Mexico, where Navajo, Apache, Pueblo, Mexicans, and Americans collided.  There is also some coverage of the prior history and prehistory of the Mexicans and "Indian" (aboriginal American) tribes in the area. Sides seems to have no theoretical axe to grind, and indeed doesn't try to explain events in terms of political or economic theories, but rather simply relates a large number of incidents in unabashed detail, letting readers draw whatever theories, if any, the reader might wish to draw.   Nevertheless Sides' account of the old U.S. frontier does shed quite a bit of light on a number of theoretical topics I have discussed here.Most of the book involves interactions between Indian tribes, often nomadic, and agricultural-based Mexican and Anglo-Saxon cultures.  The Navajo, for example, were nomadic herders that also profited from stealing, usually livestock, from nearby Pueblo, Mexican, and later United States ranches.   In his account of prehistory Sides relates how, a few hundred years before Columbus, the spectacular pueblos (apartment buildings) of the Anasazi farm-based civilization in the Chaco Canyon were abandoned just as the Navajo were migrating into Anasazi territory from the north.   Sides invokes as the main reason the popular ecological theory: that the Anasazi declined due to depleting nearby resources such as soils and forests, and suggests the Navajo as a contributing reason.I think this gets it backwards.   The Navajo entry at the same time the Anasazi's pueblos were abandoned is no coincidence, it is the main cause.   Faced by a militarily superior group of roving bandits, the Anasazi's agricultural property was no longer secure.   The Anasazi, ruled by stationary bandits, were conquered by the Navajo, nomadic herders and hunters.  Further evidence that Mancur Olson's bandit theory, rather than ecological theory, explains the abandonment of their civilization in the Chaco Canyon is that the Anasazi culture didn't disappear, it declined and moved.  Their descendants are the Pueblo Indians, and they dispersed to build a pueblos at the fringes of the Navajo territory.  ("Anasazi", incidentally, is a Navajo term meaning "ancestors of our enemies").  Accelerated depletion of resources is a symptom of insecure property rights: where property is insecure people act (with respect to natural resources rather than with respect to fellow humans) as roving bandits, whereas secure property owners extract their resources like stationary bandits, i.e. at a much lower and far more sustainable rate.Per Olson the Navajo, being roving bandits (with respect to both people and fixed resources) would have had a far higher Laffer maximum extortion rate and thus were not able to accumulate wealth to support a level of civilization nearly as high as the Anasazi under stationary bandits had supported.   The Pueblo Indians and later the Mexicans who bordered the Navajos and other roving bandit cultures were able to support agriculture, but were far poorer than other most other fully agricultural regions of the time due to the costs of Navajo and Apache raids.  The fall of the Anasazi was hardly the first time roving bandits had conquered stationary bandits causing a massive decline in wealth and civilization: it is a common pattern throughout history.(Incidentally, the Laffer maximum for banditry from a sedentary neighbor, where there are a few but not many competing bandits, is probably somewhere in between the maxima for fully roving and fully stationary bandits: Sides recounts how the Navajo would not steal every animal from their Pueblo or Mexican neighbors during raids, but made sure to leave them enough breeding stock to rebuild their herds).There are a large number of people who, following David Friedman, use the Coase Theorem as if it applied to the coercive bargaining that occurs in an anarchy.  Sides' relentless accounts of attacks and reprisals put a lie to this Coaseian analysis of anarchy.  The Navajo came as close, perhaps, to anarchy has any recorded culture has ever come.  They had, for example, no sovereign leaders with which to make binding treaties.  When American generals tried to make treaties with individuals they thought were Navajo chiefs, they would find that said "chiefs" could not actually enforce treaty terms, at least not beyond their own small band.   Thus promises, for example, by Navajo "chiefs" to stop animal-stealing raids turned out to be unenforceable, because these "chiefs" could not actually punish young men in the many other Navajo bands for their raiding.  (Even with sovereign governments there is still a tension between limiting the scope of sovereign power, e.g. by a doctrine of enumerated powers or by federalism, and giving the federal government complete "freedom of treaty", i.e. the ability to enter treaties on any subject, or at least in suppression of any kind of coercion, that they can actually enforce against their citizens and residents). Coercion in all the forms one can imagine, and many that one would rather not try to imagine, was endemic to life among the native American tribes and to relations between those tribes and encroaching civilizations of the Mexicans and later Americans.  Raids involving theft (especially of livestock), looting, kidnapping, rape, murder, war, massacre, torture, extortion, mutilation of the living and the dead, and many other, shall we say, non-Coaseian interactions were a normal part of the external relationships between the Indian tribes and between the encroaching civilizations and those tribes.  "Counting coup", that is keeping track of wrongs that needed to be avenged, was standard among the Indian cultures and became standard among people like Kit Carson who dealt with them.   Another interesting phenomenon is that the tit-for-tat cycle of violence between tribes was often based on group blame: rather than solving the (usually insurmountable) problem of identifying and punishing the particular perpetrators, missions of vengeance would usually target relatives, fellow tribe members, or even broader groups that happened to be convenient.  Sometimes Indians aggrieved by a white attack would even take revenge on whites generally, for example the next group of white emigrants to come down the Santa Fe Trail, and this far too often happened in the reverse direction as well.  Sometimes individual blame morphed into group blame when a tribe to which an alleged perpetrator was thought to belong failed to arrest and surrender the accused.   This circumstance was especially used by American armies to justify invasion, massacre, and ethnic cleansing of tribes that refused to surrender or punish (often because they had no sovereign power to capture or punish) their thieves, kidnappers, and murderers.  The role such group blame plays in contemporary politics is left as an exercise for the reader. Mancur Olson's explanations fit Sides' detailed accounts of life in an anarchy far better than the the Coaseians'. The trajectories of the Anasazi, Navajo, Pueblo, Mexicans, and Americans are classic cases of interactions between stationary and roving bandits. The Laffer maximum extortion of the stationary bandit is far lower than the combined Laffer maxima of the roving bandits.   Most kinds of farms can operate economically only if those stealing from the farm are stationary rather than roving.Finally, Sides gives a sad account of the utopian social engineering that led to America's Indian reservation system.  Bosque Redondo (the Round Forest) is a tragic example of this: an idealistic general of New England upbringing,  a forerunner is spirit at least of the Bellamies, rounded up the Navajos, marched them off to a promising-looking but empty stretch of the Pecos River and tried to teach them sedentary agriculture.  The general's overall reason for for conducting this experiment was not inaccurate: in Olson's terms, the Navajo would give up their roving banditry only if converted into (or put under the thumb of) stationary bandits.  But just as the Navajos did not learn to live like Anasazi, but instead displaced the Anasazi culture with their own, so they could not readily learn to live like Mexicans or Americans, or even like Pueblo Indians.  For example, for religious reasons they stubbornly refused to live in pueblos (apartment buildings) and these had to be abandoned.  Worse, the project had most of the trappings of utopia we would later see in the Soviet Union: forced concentration and mass movement of peoples, communal farms, and military-style central planning.  The communal property and military command structure under which the Navajo were subjected utterly failed to replicate the property rights and other crucial aspects of legal systems under which Mexicans and Americans had successfully conducted their agriculture.   The Bosque Redondo experiment was a miserable and deadly failure.  Stationary bandits can also destroy rather than allow the building of civilization if their policies are sufficiently pathological.
Alex Tabarrok writes another of his excellent (but far too infrequent) posts, this time about the problem of global warming and the relative merits of delay versus immediate action:Suppose...that we are uncertain about which environment we are in but the uncertainty will resolve over time.  In this case, there is a strong argument for delay.  The argument comes from option pricing theory applied to real options.  A potential decision is like an option, making the decision is like exercising the option.  Uncertainty raises the value of any option which means that the more uncertainty the more we should hold on to the option, i.e. not exercise or delay our decision.I agree wholeheartedly, except to stress that the typical problem is not the binary problem of full delay vs. immediate full action, but one of how much and what sorts of things to do in this decade versus future decades.  In that sense, for global warming it seems to me none too early to set up political agreements and markets we will need to incentivize greenhouse gas reductions.   Not to immediately and radically cut down emissions of greenhouse gases -- far from it -- but to learn about, experiment with, and debug the institutions we will need to reduce greenhouse emissions without creating even greater political and economic threats.   Once these are debugged, but not until then, cutting greenhouse emissions will have a far lower cost than if we panic and soon start naively building large international bureaucracies.We already know how to use markets to reduce pollution with minimal cost to industry (and minimal economic impact generally).  We now need to learn how to apply these lessons on and international level while avoiding the very real threat of the corruption and catastrophic decay of essential industries that comes from establishing new governmental institutions to radically alter their behavior.There are tons of theories about politics and economics, practically all of them highly oversimplified nonsense.   No single person knows more than a miniscule fraction of the knowledge needed to solve global warming.  Political debate over technological solutions will get us nowhere.  We won't learn much more about creating incentives to reduce greenhouse gases except by creating them and seeing how they work.  As with any social experiment, we should start small and with what we already know works well in analogous contexts -- i.e. what we already know about getting the biggest pollution reductions at the smallest costs.  The costs of the markets -- especially the target auction (and expected exchange) prices of carbon dioxide pollution units -- should thus start out small.  In that sense, the European approach under the Kyoto Protocol (the European Union Emission Trading Scheme ) provides a good model even though it has been criticized for costing industry almost nothing so far, and correspondingly producing little carbon dioxide reduction so far.  So what?  We have to learn to crawl before we can learn to walk.  The goal, certain fanatic "greens" notwithstanding, is to figure out how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, not to punish industry or return to pre-industrial economies.  Once people and organizations get used to a simple set of incentives, they can be tightened in the future in response to the actual course of global warming, in response to what we learn about global warming, and above all in what we learn from our responses to global warming.  We already know markets -- and perhaps also carefully designed carbon taxes, but as opposed to micro-regulation and getting the law involved in choosing particular technological solutions -- markets can radically reduce specific pollutants if they specific mitigation decisions are left to market participants rather than dictated by government.  And we might learn certain mitigation strategies (perhaps this one, for example) that turn out to be superior to radical carbon dioxide reductions.Let's set up and debug the basics now -- and nothing is more basic to this problem than international forums, agreements, and exchange(s) that include all countries that will be major sources of greenhouse gases over the next century.  These institutions must be designed (and this won't be easy!) for minimal transaction costs -- in particular for minimal rent-seeking and minimal corruption.  Until we've set up and debugged such a system, it could be far more catastrophic than the projected changes in the weather to impose large costs and create large bureacracies funded by premature "solutions" to the global warming problem.  As the accompanying illustrations show, a domestic United States programming that left all decisions beyond the most basic and general of market rules to the market participants -- and thus left the specific decisions to those with the most knowledge, here the electric utility companies, and minimized the threat of the rise of a corrupt bureaucracy -- was able to radically reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides (acid rain causing) pollution.  So much so that few remember that acid rain in the 1970s and 80s was a scare almost as big global warming is today. Scientists plausibly argued that our forests were in imminent danger of demise.  By experimenting with, learning about, and then exploiting the right institutions, that major pollution threat was, after methodically working through the initial learning curve, rapidly mitigated.  Global warming is an even bigger challenge than acid rain -- especially its international nature which demands the participation of all major countries -- but we now have the acid rain experience and others to learn from.  We don't have to start from scratch and we don't need to implement a crash program.  We can start with what worked quite well in the similar case of acid rain and experiment until we have figured out in reality -- not merely in shallow political rhetoric -- what will work well for the mitigation of global warming.Furthermore, it probably will pay to not impose the big costs until we've learned far more about the scientific nature of the problems (note the plural) and benefits (yes, there are also benefits, and also plural) of the major greenhouse gases, and until the various industries have learned how to efficiently address the wide variety and vast number of unique problems for industry that the general task of reducing carbon dioxide output raises.  It's important to note, however, that the scientific uncertainty, while still substantial, is nevertheless far smaller than the uncertainties of political and economic institutions and their costs.To put it succinctly -- we should not impose costs faster than industry can adapt to them, and we should not develop international institutions faster than we can debug them: otherwise the "solutions" could be far worse than the disease.Another application of Tabarrok's theory: "the" space program.  (Just the fact that people use "the" to refer to what are, or at least should be, a wide variety of efforts, as in almost any other general area of human endeavor, should give us the first big hint that something is very wrong with "it").  For global warming we may be letting our fears outstrip reality; in "the" space program we have let our hopes outstrip reality.  Much of what NASA has done over its nearly fifty year history, for example, would have been far more effective and self-sustaining if done several decades later, in a very different way, on a smaller scale, on a much lower budget, and for practical reasons, such as commercial or military reasons, rather than as ephemeral political fancies.  The best space development strategy is often to just to wait and learn -- wait until we've developed better technology and wait until we've learned more about what's available up there.  Our children will be able to do it far more effectively than we.  I understand that such waiting is excrutiatingly painful to die-hard space fans like myself, but all the more reason to beware of deluding ourselves into acting too soon.In both the global warming and space program activist camps you hear a lot of rot about how "all we need" is "the political will."  Utter nonsense.  Mostly what we need to do is wait and experiment and learn.  When the time is ripe the will is straightforward. A million-yuan giraffe, brought back to China from East Africa by a Zheng He flotilla in 1414 (click to enlarge).  Like NASA's billion-dollar moon rocks, these were not the most cost-efficient scientific acquisitions, but the Emperor's ships (and NASA's rockets) were bigger and grander than anybody else's! In the same year as the entry of this giraffe into China, on the other side of the planet, the Portuguese using a far humbler but more practical fleet took the strategic choke-point of Ceuta from the Muslims.  Who would you guess conquered the world's sea trade routes soon thereafter -- tiny Portugal with their tiny ships and practical goals, or vast China with their vast ocean liners engaging in endeavours of glory?
"Political power comes out of the barrel of a gun," Mao Zedong infamously said.  This was true in the civil wars Mao fought and  was too often true in the lawless way he oppressed his people.  It is generally true in the anarchy of international relations, and would be true for individuals if they lived without law.  People of practically all political stripes agree that the problem of force is one of the most important political problems, and I suspect most would agree with me that it is the most important problem.   It is also the central problem addressed by the law.We can start to understand both law and politics by understanding a bit of the highly evolved common law in a situation that lies close to anarchy: the obligatory gunfight in the old Western movies.  With my habitual lawyerly habit of "issue spotting," I've noticed how the good guys in these old Westerns almost always, if often barely, follow the common law of self-defense.  The white hat waits until the villain reaches for and grabs his gun -- showing intent to shoot -- before he grabs his.  This heroic habit illustrates one of the great summaries of the substance of the common law -- namely "thou shalt not initiate force" -- or, in a more peaceful setting, fraud.  If one had to summarize the substantive parts of the common law into one sentence, that would be it -- "thou shalt not initiate force or fraud."This is not to say that one can logically deduce all important parts of law or politics from such a principle -- a common mistake of ideologists.  One can no more deduce the content of the law from simple principles than one can deduce the specific sequence of an animal's genetic code from any few simple rules.  Both, in mathematical terms, have an irreducible Kolmogorov complexity and any of these kinds of summaries are quite lossy.  But it does turn out that almost all of the substantive common law operates in close proximity to that libertarian principle.There are some other good ways to summarize the common law.   "The right to be left alone" is a good brief description of our rights under criminal, tort, and property law -- in other words these are generally systems of negative rights rather than of positive rights to compel another person's affirmative effort.   Since we often don't really want to be left alone we also have contract law, which generally operates according to the principle of "keep your promises", inheritance law, "respect a dying man's wishes, and if you don't know them he meant to leave his wealth to his family," and so on.Back to our movie: let's say we come into the theater just as our hero is firing his gun.   He has already drawn his gun while the villain is still bumbling around.  Our hero shoots first and our villain crumples to the ground.   If we didn't know this was an old Western, where the hero always draws faster despite drawing second, a reasonable guess would be that our killer was able to shoot first because he drew first, and is thus a murderer.  Only in full context do we see the initiation of force and a response to it.  In isolation, the response to force is often indistinguishable from the initiation of force.   We often can't know for sure whether an act of coercion is an unlawful initiation of force or a lawful response to it until we've seen the entire film (and in modern Hollywood, not even then, though I digress).  Or, to change metaphors and introduce a bit legalese, we often don't have probable cause to believe someone has initiated force until we've assembled some pieces of the puzzle.  Learning to some even greater degree -- clear and convincing evidence in some private cases and beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases -- who initiated force requires even more pieces.   Furthermore, to achieve justice -- to deter, to exact retribution, to make whole the victim, or to heal the sick criminal, whichever one or more of these we take to be the goal of justice -- we must almost always respond to force with force.  Taken in isolation that response will itself look like an initiation of force.  Furthermore, to gather the evidence we need in most cases to achieve sufficient high levels of confidence -- whether balance of the probabilities, clear and convincing evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt -- we often have to initiate force with third parties -- to compel them to hand over goods, to let us search their property, or to testify.  If politics could be deduced this might be called the Central Theorem of Politics -- we can't properly respond to a global initiation of force without local initiations of force.  Again keeping in mind that we are leaving out many important exceptions and details, we might summarize good legal procedure -- and more abstractly, the way a good political system should respond to force -- as follows:(1) An initiation of force might have occurred(2) Learn enough, without responding with force of our own, until we have probable cause to believe an initiation of force has occurred.(3) Respond with our own force in order to arrest the persons, valuables, and evidence involved, and engage in the trial(s) and other procedures necessary to convince those most highly knowledgeable about the case, and if it is important enough the world generally, that an initiation of force indeed occurred.(I'm neglecting, of course, the controversial issue of preventing force by initiating force -- in the international context by invading Iraq to prevent supposed weapons of mass destruction, in the individual context by capturing a terrorist before they've actually committed an act of terror.   This is dangerous territory that goes beyond the general responsive workings of legal procedure, and will be hopefully a topic I address another day).In Hollywood our hero has a quick eye and thereby instantly achieves probable cause that our villain has reached for his gun and is threatening to fire.  In reality, the evidence is usually far more dispersed and we must be far more careful, lest our supposed response to force actually be an initiation of force.Since force is the central problem of politics, a political system, whether proposed or real, that cannot distinguish an initiation of force from a proper response to force -- that cannot distinguish an arrest of a person from a kidnapping, an arrest of goods from theft, and so on -- is worth less than the paper it's written on.  And if it merely waves its hands and invokes the magic of "the government" or "the market" to solve all such problems, it is extremely lame -- and quite at odds with how our highly evolved common law legal procedures actually work.   The common law does not, as the law of self-defense suggests, necessarily require "the government" for a legally forceful response to force.  But neither, as we shall now see, do its legal procedures operate in any way resembling the laws of economics in a voluntary market.Recall our Central Theorem of Politics -- we can't properly respond to a global initiation of force without a local initiation of force.  We could deduce, if law could be deduced, that legal procedure thus might be full of local initiations of force -- and in fact it is.   Legal procedure, in sharp contrast to good substantive law, does not involve merely negative rights "to be left alone," but in addition is full of positive rights.  It is full of procedures for interfering with persons and property, both with the defendant who might have initiated force and with some third parties who are not accused of initiating force.  The right to sue, for example -- necessary for the enforcement of any private substantive right -- is a bundle of positive rights that usually includes the right to compel a jury to sit and the right to compel witnesses as well as a right to compel the the alleged initiator in various ways.   Proper response to the initiation of force would be extremely and quite unreasonably hobbled without these coercive mechanisms, these positive rights of legal procedure.  And unless the disputing parties have arranged things ahead of time, the exercise of jurisdiction by our "responder to force," the court, is involuntary for at least one of them.   Often the responder has to be backed by some kind of police force, or an extreme cases even an army, if justice is to be achieved.  It is preventing the abuse of all this power -- including figuring out ways to minimize the power without overly reducing our ability to resond to force -- that is the central problem of politics.   Ideological purists can whine all they want about the supposed injustices of the coercion inherent in legal procedure, but "thou shalt not initiate force" is merely a useful summary of the substantive common law and in no way provides a useful summary of the procedural common law, much less a principle for its operation.  The job of legal procedure -- and of good politics generally -- is to respond to initiation of force with its own local initiations of force in order to achieve justice: to punish the initiator of force and to provide restitution to his victim.  Whatever form this response might take -- whether a nation-state making war or enforcing law through its courts, or parties who have previously agreed resolving their dispute through a private court, or a shopping mall security guard arresting a shoplifter, or our quick-draw Western hero --  whatever form response to force may take, it is crucial that law carefully defines the proper ways for making such responeses and that we put limits on these methods to prevent abuses.  It's also crucial to realize that any princples by which we might do so will tend to be very different than those of the substantive law being enforced.
A nice illustration of the major flaw I have described in the Coase Theorem.  Much of what is valuable in the above link I actually wrote in the comments and will now foreground with some minor edits:A music store is next door to a doctor's office. The music store would prefer (if the office of a rich doctor who wants quiet for his patients did not exist next door) to let its customers test its electric guitars at volume VM1 > 0. The doctor prefers it to be quieter (VD < VM1). Coase theory assumes that the only possible choices are within the range {VM1, VD}, i.e. any volume of electric guitar testing in between or including these two preferences. In the absence of transaction costs and given only this range, one can indeed conclude that the music store and the doctor will bargain to an efficient outcome. But these aren't the only choices. The music store can, at additional cost to itself C, turn up the volume nobs on its amplifiers and play the music at volume VM2 > VM1. If the doctor is willing to pay the music store P1 to change the volume from VM1 to VD, and P2 > P1 + C to turn the volume down from VM2 to VD, the music store has an incentive to play the music at volume VM2 instead of VM1, or to threaten same, in order to extract for itself a greater benefit from the situation.In other words, the same physical effect that produced the externality gives rise to an opportunity and incentive to play a negative-sum game. Here it changes the music store's prefered volume in the absence of a rich doctor next door from VM1, to VM2 > VM1, due to the opportunity to extort extra payments from the doctor by creating an even less bearable din, for which the doctor is willing to pay even more to avoid. The music store is willing to incur an extra cost C to itself in order to extract the greater payment P2 from the doctor. For the overall game the payment P2 is a wash and C makes it negative-sum. (In the music store example, cost C comes from the music store chasing away some of its own customers, albeit at a slower rate than it chases away the doctor's customers, by testing its guitars more noisly than it would prefer in the absence of the doctor).If, as in reality, there are transaction costs causing bargains to sometimes not be reached, the outcome is even worse, as noise VM2 is costlier, perhaps far more costlier, to the doctor's practice than VM1: such outcomes are often far worse outcome under transaction costs than the range of possible outcomes that Coaseians contemplate.Of course, more generally in the absence of proper prior legal allocations of rights the doctor and music store could threaten each other in other ways: the doctor could threaten to poison the guitar frets, the music store could call in the mob on the doctor, etc.(Furthermore, even with tort law preventing these other negative-sum games the music store has an incentive to falsely "reveal" preference VM2 instead of VM1 to the doctor and to the judge -- a common problem that good tort law usually, but hardly with perfection, tackles). The example of the music store and its amplifier volume shows that the externality itself contains potential or actual coercion -- the same physical effect that causes the externality often makes negative-sum games possible, and in the absence of any prior legal limits on the externality, opportunities and incentives for coercive negative-sum games are inherent in the externality -- so that analyses of such externalities with the Coase Theorem, which assumes such games don't exist, will often lead to misleading or false conclusions.The game being played here by the music store is negative-sum for the same reason a tax is, firstly because the music store's coercion distorts the behavior of the doctor and his patients. Assuming the doctor is helpless to stop the noise without making the payoff (e.g. we artificially assume he can't order a mob hit on the music store, or poison its customers, or emit any other such "extreme" externality to avenge or deter the music store's excess externality) he will go golfing more, and see fewer patients, if he is paying P2 to the store instead of P1. Fewer patients will be healed, a net loss of welfare. Since we assume the music store is rational, it will demand only the Laffer-maximum amount of extortion, but Laffer-maximum taxes still have plenty of distoritve effects that produce inefficiencies compared to the no-taxation case. Secondly, the behavior of the music store is also distorted because it has excess profits to spend. It will invest its extra money in opening new music stores and concert halls next to other doctor's offices, nursing homes, and similar because that is a lucrative source of profit, and so other activities that would prefer quiet will be distorted in turn. It is often unreasonable to assume that Coaseian payees are spending their extra money efficiently. Interestingly, Gary Becker assumed the Coaseian payor's behavior was not distorted and that the Coaseian payee was spending its extra profits efficiently, and used this Coaseian reasoning to argue that governments themselves are efficient outcomes of Coaseian bargaining.  Becker's argument is wrong for the same reason that [anarcho-capitalist David] Friedman's [Coaseian] argument is wrong for legal protection agencies: it doesn't account for the economic distortions caused by coercion.To see where these negative-sum games lead, let's take the case of roving loudspeakers. Pickup trucks drive through the city, parking in front of every business in turn and demanding large payments to take their noise elsewhere. The optimal extortion for the extortors in this case is nearly 100% of all business wealth in the city (again assuming the victims are defenseless), because if extortor A doesn't extort any remaining wealth extortor B will be happy to come in and take it. The economy is so distorted that practically nothing gets produced or distributed and the city's economy collapses. This is the "roving bandit" case studied by Mancur Olson. Where two stores are next to each other and neither can move constitute "stationary bandits", as do gangs or governments with "monopolies of coercion" over fixed territories. As the roving loudspeakers case illustrates, rational stationary bandits collect a far lower percent of their victims' profits in taxes than do roving bandits. (But stationary bandits with the much lower rate than 100% end up collecting a far higher absolute amount -- recall the Laffer curve) . If on the other hand we assume the victims are not defenseless, we have negative-sum games like hawk/dove, negative tit-for-tat, etc. which again are paradigmatically very different from voluntary Coaseian bargains.We can measure the effectiveness of an excess (or coercive) externality for extracting super-Coasiean payoffs by how great a harm the externality can produce for the least cost to the emitter. The ubiquity of technology that is very effective in producing the greatest harm for the least cost, i.e. weapons, in our world should be a very good clue that our world is not Coaseian. Music volume, spark emission, and so on beyond the "preferred" level Coaseians falsely assume to be maximal are logically weapons. Their harm/cost ratio is lower than guns, tanks, bombers, missiles, flamethrowers, herbicides, and so on, but they have an advantage in being physically hard to distinguish from merely Coaseian externalities, which would come in handy in a world where judges and other lawmakers actually based law on the Coase theorem (the good news is that they mostly don't).
October 23rd will be the fiftieth anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution. It was a glorious lost cause; glorious enough that Hungary, and the world, won in the long run.The Hungarian American Federation has a great 1956 page. Wikipedia has a good article. My alma mater happens to have a good collection of historical documents related to the Revolution, along with an introduction to the events. Here is an old newsreel that provides a good overview. Even Quentin Tarantino helped make a movie about the Revolution and a nasty game of water polo.My dad was one of those students who wouldn't put up with tyranny. Besides communism being defeated in the end, there was a bright spot for myself and my siblings in particular: it brought my dad to America to meet my mom, making us possible. :-) But thousands of Hungarians didn't make it through November.
I am quite chagrined that a number of influential folks have almost reached the same conclusion as I, namely they've concluded that "speculation" not fundamentals are driving most of the recent commodities rise, yet they reach a policy conclusion that is utterly insane: restrict or ban much of this "speculation".  They stop at the word "speculation", repelled in horror by the idea, and don't take it a step farther -- ask why this "speculation" is going on. A good clue comes from those responsible for the biggest piece of it -- retirement funds. Retirement funds have long been heavy, relative to other kinds of funds, on less volatile (over <15 year periods) investments like bonds. But bonds are mostly denominated in dollars. With the threat of dollar inflation (apparent from the recent drop in the dollar, from recent Fed activity, and from the history of the floating dollar in the 1970s) they have a fiduciary responsibility to protect their investors' retirement nest eggs by hedging bond positions with commodities baskets. And that is just what they have been doing.   Besides providing an inflation hedge and a performance comparable to bonds since the dawn of the floating dollar era in 1970, commodities are also "anti-correlative", i.e. they tend to move in the opposite direction of stocks and bonds, substantially reducing the risk of the overall portfolio.  To suggest that commodities are not proper vehicles for investment in this era of the floating dollar is stunningly pathological, but that hasn't stopped a number of people who should know better from suggesting this.(I suspect a similar explanation is behind much of the high Chinese demand -- but that rather than buying futures they are actually stockpiling commodities, including cutting back on production of the mineral reserves that they own, to hedge their peg to the U.S. dollar, their massive dollar earnings from exports, and their heavy investments in U.S. Treasuries, all of which are vulnerable to dollar drop or inflation -- but I don't know where data on such stockpiling activity might be readily available).Many of these retirement funds can be politically influential. I wish, for the sake of the retirees they have a duty to protect, they would defend themselves politically against the insane proposals to restrict or ban commodity index funds. Those seeking to save for retirement have perfectly good and strong reasons for investing in commodity indices: they don't want to see their retirement funds eroded away by inflation, as happened to millions of seniors in the 1970s. More generally, people have a right to be free from ignorant government interference and federal spite when they choose to hold their savings in forms protected from the erosion of the dollar.Commodity index exchange traded funds (ETFs) have allowed people to construct, without many of the costs, risks, and complexities of direct purchases of commodity futures, retirement portfolios hedged against inflation.  Portfolios protected against inflation are an exceedingly valuable asset both for the retirees and for the society on which said retirees will be less dependent.  They are also quite valuable for many other kinds of investors, such as college endowments that lower the cost of tuition for future students and fund research that benefits the future of us all.  Instead of attacking the fever by shutting down the immune system, i.e. instead of attacking the commodities indices needed to hedge against inflation, it is the prior main cause of the problem, Federal Reserve monetary policy, that needs to be addressed.  The Fed needs to put a higher priority on preserving the value of the dollar and fighting inflation, and it needs to use leading indicators (e.g. commodity and foreign exchange prices) far more than trailing indicators (e.g. CPI, PPI) in this task. (I understand of course that the recent credit crunch has probably been a very good reason for the Fed to "print dollars." That doesn't change the fact that the Fed is smack dab in the middle of the causal chain that has led to the commodities boom, and that savers have a right, and investment funds a fiduciary duty, to protect their savings against the inflationary effects of Fed policy).It's certainly possible that some of the commodities boom is a bubble. It is often the case that economically efficient bull markets become overextended into wasteful bubbles, it being very hard to tell just how large of a price increase is actually warranted, and we may be seeing some of that now.  (These bubbles are allowed to occur by a lack of available instruments for speculation, especially the transaction costs involved in holding long-term short positions against markets that may rise substantially further before they fall.  The worst way to combat a bubble is to ban the last modicum of imperfect speculative mechanisms such as short sales that currently prevent bubbles from getting worse). There is no easy way to gauge just how much retirement funds and others seeking to hedge inflation need to allocate to commodities baskets in order to optimize their portfolios, because it depends greatly on future Fed behavior. On the one hand we know that hyperinflation has sometimes occurred historically with floating currencies, so that dramatic further increases in commodity prices are possible; on the other hand the farther commodity prices go up (and they have gone up very far indeed) without corresponding inflation in other goods and services, the more downside price risk there is in commodities.  Oil next year might be $40 per barrel, or $300 per barrel, or anything in between.  It's certainly true that commodities have become a far riskier, i.e. more volatile, investment than they were three years ago, and that puts a severe limit on the proportion of an investment portfolio it makes sense to devote to commodities.   But that proportion is certainly nowhere near zero as the lunatic anti-"speculation" activists would have it.(This post is based on a comment I made on a previous post.  Here,, h/t to reader "munin", is a hedge fund guy who reaches almost the right theory, but the abominable policy conclusion, and is the source of the graph above.  Here is some of my previous writing on this subject: The Monetary Value of Liquid Commodities and Commodity Derivatives: The New Currencies).[Update: at least we don't have war hysteria (or click to enlarge the facsimile at left).  Note that Herber Hoover, who many history books still proclaim with preposterous prevarication to have been a free market guy, and who later presided over the start of the Great Depression, was at this time (1917) the head of President Wilson's Food Administration, which came up with this plan for "Control of Food By Government".  Hoover's food plan, like the crazy plans to "fix" the commodities markets today, was designed by and for the ignorant and the paranoid, targetting "Evils" of "Unreasonable Profits, Speculation, and Hoarding", i.e. the "evils" of people stocking up to ensure own and their customers' future food supply instead of letting the benevolent Herbert Hoover control it for them. Today it is apparently evil to protect your retirement nest egg instead of letting it fall with the dollar].
Continuing at long last with my series on the history of Roman law, I will introduce two of the central players: the administrator and legal scholar Tribonian and his master Justinian, emperor of the late Roman ("Byzantine") empire from 527-565 A.D.   Today however, a bit about the importance of their legal code.If law shapes society’s most basic structures, as master genes -- genes that control other genes -- shape the basic form of our bodies, then Justinian's Code is the ancestral master DNA of the West.  If society is a protocol stack and law is a low-level protocol governing our higher-level interactions of politics and commerce, then it's fair to say that the Justinian Code was the Internet Protocol that long governed, and still in many ways governs, the Web that is Western society.If tech metaphors don't do it for you, let's try religion: Justinian was the Moses of the Western legal world.  When the first universities, which were practically just law schools, were founded in Italy in the 11th century, the newly rediscovered Justinian Code was the main draw and the center of the curriculum.   Variations of the legal system of Justinian and Tribonian have been taught in Western universities, and often enacted into the law of Western societies, ever since.   And indeed in the 19th and 20th centuries these variations were enacted into law all over the world.   The only substantial exception, a partial exception, to the overwhelming influence of this code has been the English legal system and its offshoots.   Ideas derived from Justinian's Code also form many of the basic and often flawed assumptions of the political science and philosophy of law taught in universities to this day.The Romans had a highly evolved substantive law of crime, torts (“delicts”), property, contracts, and many other commercial and personal matters.   In these areas the preservation and recovery of the Roman law was indispensible.    The influence of the procedural and constitutional aspects of Justinian's Code was quite another matter, as I hope to detail in future posts.   The strong influence of Justinian and Tribonian over Western procedural and constitutional law started with the universities, continued in the Romanization of Continental law during and after the Renaissance, accelerated with the codifications of the Prussians and Napoleon of the 18th and 19th centuries, and reached its zenith with the totalitarian dicatorships of the 20th century.   Only some of the odious influence of the procedural law that Tribonian and his crew assembled and drafted for their master has gone into perhaps temporary decline since then.  The historian Procopius, who served in Justinian's army, was a superstitious, or at least creatively metaphorical, man who thought that Justinian was a fiend sent from hell to do maximum destruction to the world.  That opinion was only based on the consequences of Justinian in his own lifetime.   The cumulative influence of his procedural and constitutional laws on the world since that time has been overwhelmingly more harmful.Tribonian in the service of Justinian introduced and passed on fundamental flaws in the Western political DNA.   Or, to switch back to our other tech metaphor, some severe bugs in the lowest layer of our society’s protocol stack.Coming up: introductions to Justinian and Tribonian.
Davy Crockett served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1827-31 and 1833-35.  He later fought for the Texas Revolution and died at the Alamo.   While in the House, Edward Ellis recalled him as making this speech on the propriety and constitutionality of Congress acting like a charity with the taxpayer's money.
I once described how confidential auditing was possible and beneficial:The auditing function is a vast and indispensable part of the modern economy. Auditing controls allow, among other things, employers to delegate resources and authority to employees, franchisors to delegate to franchisees, stockholders to delegate to management, advertisers to count eybeballs, marketers to gather more reliable data on customers, and make possible a wide variety of other such relationships. Auditing controls might fairly be called the security protocols of capitalism...[However,] auditing is in deep conflict with efforts towards greater privacy. Auditors have an ethic of recording, investigating, and reporting as much as possible, and often see privacy efforts as attempts to prevent auditing and potentially cover up fraud...[But confidential auditing is possible because] we can achieve auditing logs unforgeable after commitment via secure timestamps. We can then achieve to a great extent unforgeability prior to commitment, with segregation of duties via multiparty integrity constraints. We then audit these commitments via multiparty private computations.In an article about multiparty secure (i.e. private) computations I described this process as follows:Performance phase analysis with multiparty secure computer theory would seem to apply only to those contracts which can be performed inside the virtual computer. But the use of post-unforgeable auditing logs, combined with running auditing protocols inside the shared virtual computer, allows a wide variety of performances outside the virtual computer to at least be observed and verified by selected arbitrators, albeit not proactively self-enforced.The participants in this mutually confidential auditing protocol can verify that the books match the details of transactions stored in a previously committed transaction log, and that the numbers add up correctly. The participants can compute summary statistics on their confidentially shared transaction logs, including cross-checking of the logs against counterparties to a transaction, without revealing those logs. They only learn what can be inferred from the statistics; [they] can't see the details of the transactionsIn this I had been inspired by Eric Hughes' idea of encrypted open books.  My sketch is more general insofar as it addresses pre-transaction forging (with separation of duties), post-transaction forging (with secure timestamping), and the auditing protocol itself (with multiparty private computation running off the logs themselves rather than Hughes' specialized protocol running off already prepared books).  But my description was only a proof-of-concept sketch that one could go all the way from preparing to transact to transaction log to finished audits while maintaining both integrity and privacy, with neither depending on large amounts of trust in the auditors.  Recently Shen et. al. came up with a detailed design of such a confidential auditing scheme in the context of gathering statistics from the logs of distributed computations:...no single TTP [trusted third party] node can have the full knowledge of the logs, and thus no single node can misuse the log information without being detected.  On the basis of a relaxed form of secure distributed computing paragidms, one can implement confidential auditing service so that the auditor can retrieve certain aggregated system information e.g., the number of transactions, the total volume, the event traces, etc., without having to access the full log data...To prevent an unsupervised TTP from manipulating the system, we design query processing schemes that require TTP nodes work together, using the multiparty private computation, to perform any useful auditing functions. 
Reader Matt comments on the Malthusian isocline here,, observing that I placed 17th century Britain a bit "higher" (presumably meaning more advanced, i.e. more "northeast") on the graph than 17th century China.My placement in this case of one absolutely more advanced than the other is highly conjectural.  It's worse than comparing apples to oranges.   I had to put them somewhere on the graph and I used my best judgment.   Britain was semi-pastoral (yet still stationary) while China had a much more productive climate for grain agriculture (much wetter in the summer and drier in the winter than Britain) and thus could support a far higher population density per hectare.  But whether the Chinese population density per hectare adjusted for these natural advantages (presumably leaving technological and institutional differences, what I call denstiy per natural global hectare), which is what I'm trying to graph on my x-axis, was still much higher is far more conjectural.  If we draw the x-axis as just population density per hectare (rather than "natural hectare", i.e. adjusted for natural advantages) the Chinese point is far higher, not just somewhat higher as I drew it, and thus China's isocline was clearly more advanced, but I argue due to natural advantages rather than technology or institutions.  In terms of technology and institutions, it's worse than apples to oranges not only because of the radical difference between their basic agricultural strategy (labor-intensive grain-and-bean vs. semi-pastoral and heavy use of draft animals) but each had a number of advanced agricultural techniques the other rarely or never used. See here and here for the background to these theories and the graph in question, as well as a very interesting film of street scenes that allow us to compare the Chinese and British street transportation in the early 20th century (largely before the IC engine replaced horses and rickshaws).Note that in contrast to the above graph which is schematic and partially conjectural, the following, showing the relentless advanced of the isocline in England from the Late Middle Ages, is based on actual statistics of population and real agricultural labor wage income based on a food-dominated commodity basket:This differs from the "noisy until 1800" graph of Clark because I've graphed 80-year averages rather than decadal averages to smooth out the noise of pests and short-term climate variations on the quality of harvests which dominated the position of the isocline before the 19th century.   The points are from the data but the slope of the isoclines I drew threw them are still conjectural.Much less conjectural than the relative levels of European and Asian 17th century isoclines and probably more important for the issue of how Britain escaped from the Malthusian trap is that the British laborer and peasant per capita nutrition (roughly corresponding to real income in an era where food dominated the peasant and laborer budget) was much higher than the Chinese.  Britain had more and higher quality protein in the diet (partly from more dairy, which has genetic causes, but mainly from more meat, the British having a stationary yet semi-pastoral agriculture).  China, having far fewer draft animals per capita, used laborers for arduous and repetitive tasks the Brits considered fit only for draft animals. Part of Britain's better marginal standard of living can be put to disease, especially the Black Death, but by the 18th century I'd agree that Britain was as healthy as China.   What we see after the Black Death is that the Brits greatly increased their meat-eating and use of draft animals, and, what is more important and seemingly unprecedented, were largely able to keep up this intensive use of livestock after their population recovered and even boomed beyond pre-Plague levels, whereas in (AFAIK all) prior agricultural eras and areas increasing human populations in recovery from plagues replaced draft animal with human labor and moved the diet towards grains and away from meat: sliding "souteast" down a static isocline.   Also frequent periods of war and excess taxation had often led to the loss of draft animals and their replacement by human labor, in these cases with a regressing (moving "southwest") isocline.  In both cases the capital accumulated in draft animals and meat livestock was destroyed.  As Steve Sailer correctly points out, in Great Britain there has not been a major famine since before the Black Death while in China they were common until very recently.  After the Black Death British agriculture went through a very long period of capital accumulation, in the form of soil conditioners (especially lime), commercial seeds and breeding, engineered water meadows that replaced phosphates and other scarce nutrients, drainage (important in the wet British winters), crops and rotations that fixed more nitrogen (at first growing beans for fodder, then replacing beans with the even better nitrogen fixer clover), and many other improvements besides the tremendous accumulation of livestock.  Indeed "improvement" was the watchword of British agriculture as soon as works about it started being published.So the Chinese peasant and laborer worked harder on a worse diet and lived much closer to starvation, whereas in hard times British peasants could go back to eating the foods that after the Black Death they considered animal fodder (beans, oats, etc.) whereas the analogous soybean was a protein staple of the Chinese peasant as much as it was animal fodder. Again this doesn't tell us whether China's isocline adjusted for its natural advantages was more or less advanced, it tells us that Britain was operating with a higher marginal and mean per capita standard of living and lower population density relative to its natural advantages than China, i.e. further "northwest" on its isocline.Besides the Columbian Exchange, and even more important, there may have been an even greater but far less heralded exchange going on between Europe and East Asia in the centuries after Europe established regular oceanic contact between the two.  Not so much in species, but in techniques and institutions, aided by cheap paper, the printing press, and the resulting expansion of literacy.   As this contact increases we see both the East Asian and Western European isoclines advancing rapidly.  But the British isocline was advancing faster than Asia's (regardless of which was more advanced absolutely), and probably more importantly in Britain and at least early on the Netherlands were largely maintaining the higher peasant/laborer standard of living despite population growth, whereas in East Asia until the 20th century the isocline started at an already low per-capita income yet the advance was still directly entirely rightward towards higher population growth rather than in catching up to British marginal standards of living.  So Britain kept its big lead in per-capita standard of living and farm labor productivity, and thus presumably in the proportion of surplus labor that could be put to work on non-agricultural tasks.  And since Britain did not need as large an army as a Continental power, nor as high taxes to support it, more of this labor could go into industry.Another major factor in industrialization was urbanization, that is the proportion of this surplus labor that could be relocated where other industry or industrial resources were available rather than to where the food was grown.  Urbanization (and presumably the general proportion of non-agricultural population) during the 17th-19th centuries was growing rapidly in both Western Europe, especially Britain, and Tokugawa Japan but less so in China, a phenomenon I have yet to see explained (draft animals can't explain the Japanese case as they resembled China in being relatively bereft of them).  As far as agriculture and urbanization goes, contrary to myth Tokugawa Japan saw great progress, almost as much as Britain during the same period, albeit much less technological progress in industry than Britain.  Urbanization depended most on water transport, i.e. the ability to transport grain to remote regions (the same thing that made ancient Rome a very large city, in her case grain imports across the Mediterranean from Sicily and Egypt).  Without good water transport labor beyond that needed for agriculture had to stay in the rural areas near where the grain was grown.   Japan, Britain, and the Netherlands had good water transport with many farmers near navigable water due to geography and engineering to extend the navigability of rivers and especially in the Netherlands to build canals which served a triple role of defense barrier, water control for reclamation of formerly submerged areas, and transport.  Britain and the Netherlands also had an advantage in that their preferred and available source of protein, beef, could be transported over long distances over land on the hoof, whereas the pigs, fowl, and soybeans of the Chinese required water transport.  Urbanization and industrialization also required transport for fuel (wood and coal: forests near navigable water were soon denuded and forests far from navigable water were generally useless.  The Brits could use far more forest area per capita because their draft animals could transport more timber and fuel farther.  Both the Brits and Chinese had ample and easy-to-mine coal but only in Britain were there mines within ox- or horse-transport distances of navigable water combined with a plentiful supply of these draft animals, which explains why Britain was possibly mining more coal than the rest of the world combined by the 17th century.  Horse gin powered pumps also drained the British coal mines before the dawn of the Savery and Newcomen steam engines).China had for many centuries also had good water transport due to the Grand Canal and its tributaries, but perhaps because of its artificial and inland nature it was far more bureaucratically controlled and subject to excess taxation and other institutional problems than the coastal transport in Japan and Britain.  Japan, with its long and thin coastline, probably had the greatest amount of farmland next to coastline controlled by peoples speaking a single language and thus able to trade food with low transaction costs.   But Britain's advantage in draft animals more than made up for having a fatter island, as their horses probably made four or more times as much farmland accessible to the navigable water than the mostly human-powered Japanese transport, and its horses also increased the efficiency of river navigations and (eventually) canals.   After the railroad, and even moreso the IC engine, reached Japan it quickly caught up to and leapfrogged ahead of Britain (something Clark's theory can't explain).
What could be wrong with more fun jobs for lawyers?
Standard political "science", on which both academic and popular modern views of politics are now based, has beat into our heads a false dichotomy: "government" vs. "anarchy."  The first, it is assumed, is sovereign government: it has a "monopoly of force."   The second is often viewed as either an imaginary world of violent lawlessness or an imaginary world of purely voluntary relationships.  But this excludes what much of the politics and law of England and its colonial offshoots, among many other examples, were for most of their history: divided, non-sovereign governments.  Law enforcement with no monopoly of force. There are a number of kinds of such division -- the most familar being federalism and the separation of powers. But the most interesting of all is the unbundling of political property rights.I have explained why law generally cannot be enforced by purely voluntary relationships.  Sure, most rules, formal and informal, of society can be and are followed in a largely voluntary fashion.  Reputation and other factors can provide incentives to follow many kinds of rules.  But when either the threat or the response become violent or overly fraudulent real law, i.e. law based on local initiations of force, is generally required.   Murray Rothbard's fallacy was to try to extend a general principle that succinctly summarizes the substantitve common law -- non-initiation of force -- to the procedural law, which it does not properly summarize and where it mostly does not belong.Defining "government" as any relationship that is not purely voluntary, what forms of such "government" maximize liberty by minimizing exit costs?  Unbundled political property rights put the lie to the "monopoly of force" by unbundling the use of force into a wide variety of specialized forms -- each owned by a particular organization or individual.   Here, for example, are some examples of political property rights from medieval and Renaissance England:There were dozens of standard jurisdictional franchises. For example, "infangthief" enabled the franchise owner to hang any thief caught red-handed in the franchise territory, whereas "outfangthief" enabled the owner to chase the thief down outside the franchise territory, catch him red-handed, and then hang him. "Gallows" enabled the owner to try and punish any capital crime, and there were a variety of jurisdictions correponding to several classes of lesser offenses. "View of frankpledge" allowed the owner to control a local militia to enforce the law. "The sheriff's pleas" allowed the owner to hear any case that would normally be heard in a county court. There were also franchises that allowed the collection of various tolls and taxes.Modern remnants of such jurisdictions include the shopkeeper's privilege to arrest and imprison shoplifters, "stand your ground" statutes which recapitulate the traditional political property right, liberty of house, citizen's arrest, and so on.   Even such a behemoth as the United States has nothing resembling a "monopoly of force."Political property rights are narrowly defined rights to initiate force -- in very specific ways and in response to specific events and no others.  Their legal exercise generally requires the owner to scrupulously follow specific procedures.  Unbundled political property rights can reduce exit costs far more than sovereign governments, because they don't come bundled with the power to exclude normally associated with sovereignty and real property (much let the power to prevent people from leaving exercised by the more tyrranous sovereigns).   It is thus possible to have a wide variety of jurisdictions enforcing law without any restrictions on the freedom of travel of those acting within the law.  But unbundled political property rights do radically violate the nonsensical poli-sci dichotomy of sovereign government vs. anarchy that is taught in schools.   Unbundled political property rights are neither sovereign government nor purely voluntary.  But they are a crucial part of a world that maximizes liberty.(This post is expanded from comments I made at Unqualified Reservations).
There is a long-standing controversy about the idea of parliamentary supremacy -- the idea that legislative law trumps all other law. That is currently the dominant theory in England, but the United States holds a contrary view -- here judges review legislative laws against a prior and higher law: a written constitution (and perhaps also against natural law, but that is a subject we won't pursue here).Parliamentary supremacy was not always the view in England. Sir Edward Coke, for example, considered some old statutes and case precedents part of a higher "common law" that could on occasion trump statute. Coke's doctrine was not overtly repudiated by English legal courts for several hundred years, but neither was it strictly followed by later judges. Parliamentary supremacy was a major legal issue in the American Revolution which separated the United States from England.One of the problems with the modern debate over this issue is that the question is put in modern terms that assume that statute and case law where on point must always be followed --the modern rigid view of written law. But this was, if out of practical necessity if for no other reason, not the medieval view of the law. Books (or, more often, scrolls) of statutes and case records were often locked in dusty libraries where students and barristers and attorneys and even judges had difficulty gaining access to them. Sometimes they had simply been destroyed. As a result, prior to the 16th century printed editions, much of the learning about the law came from oral instruction rather than books. It was gestalt in nature. This rendered it, by our standards,very flexible but also disconcertingly uncertain. Not only did judges sometimes forget statutes and cases; they could often also effectively just ignore statute or case precedent if they felt it didn't lead to a just outcome in the case at hand. The legal historian Theodore Plucknett, for example, recorded several medieval cases where statutory law was clearly on point but ignored. Judges thus could effectively nullify statutory law, which is even more powerful than the ability to review statutes against a higher law. Records of cases prior to the 16th only rarely cite either statutes or prior cases, but simply declare what the interlocutor believes the law to be.Another crucial point is that up to the 16th century in England (and even, at least nominally, somewhat later) parliamentary statute was consideredto be an opinion about what the law was, not a statement of new law. The same held true for case precedent (and nominally still does even up to today). Of course, in reality law was always evolving, and statutes might indeed radically change things. But this ancient attitude towards the law was plausible at the time, again due to the primarily oral nature of the law, and it had legal consequences. It meant, first of all, that the modern "last-in-time rule" (when two statutes conflict, the later statute has effectively repealed the earlier one) was not in force -- a later statute could be reviewed equally against an earlier statute and the judge could decide which version most suited the case. Thus the earlier statute was neither a higher law (as in modern judicial review against a constitution), nor a lower law (as in the modern "last-in-time" rule) but merely another opinion about the law to be weighed against the more recent opinion. The more recent or more ancient statute might weigh more heavily depending on which was considered more authoritative Secondly, the fact that statutes were merely an opinion about the law, not the law itself, gave a judge justification to ignore them when they felt they were not very authoritative, which for the practical reasons cited above they often did. If you couldn't remember the law but had to look it up (which before printed editions could involve quite a bit of trouble), it probably was not so authoritative. Third, it meant that there could be two leading theories about judicial review against case law:(1) Parliamentary statutes trump cases from the Kings Bench, Chancery, and other courts because Parliament is the highest court in the land.(2) Parliamentary statutes are simply dicta (since they typically did not involve a specific case and controversy brought to trial), and therefore take lower priority than case precedent.I'm not aware of any participant in this debate expressing the second theory, but some might have thought it implied, as I do. The first theory has often been cited as the leading argument for parliamentary supremacy, but not much before Blackstone made it popular in the late 18th century.Sir Edward Coke, the leading opponent of Parliamentary supremacy, (and whose opinion in Dr. Bonham's case is perhaps the only unequivocal precedent against such supremacy), muddled the issue by often quoting at least one old statute, the Magna Carta, as a law that trumped later statute. Coke effectively treated the Magna Carta as the United States treats our Constitution. In the habits of the time, he simply weighed its authority very highly. An argument for Coke's view is that Magna Carta took the form of a property grant that effected the entire property of the realm (including all incorporeal rights, such as what we call civil liberties), and that it was a charter for England itself analogous to the charters the king was granting for early American colonies at the time, which trumped the statutes of the resulting colonial legislatures.But Coke also considered certain long-standing procedural doctrines derived from case precedent, such as the right to a properly trained judge, to be part of the higher law against which statutes should be reviewd. He did not consider most everyday aspects of what we now call the common law (the law of real property, tort, etc.) to be part of this higher common law that trumped statute. Rather, the higher common law was confined to certain important procedural rights, similar in style to those later found in the United States Bill of Rights.Americans had a stronger case for judicial review. First, our (mostly corporate) colonial governments were franchises expressly set up by charter. The power of colonial legislatures was thus not unlimited, but rather was constrained by clauses in the charter. Colonial legislators could not, for example, deny the king his right to customs, and could not contravene the English liberties of residents, since these rights were both expressly reserved in the charter grants. So judicial review became the American habit from the start. Second, these charters were printed, thus immediately available to the judge and all parties; this and the fact that they were a higher law than local legislative statute helped them to be applied, using the modern view of written law, and a strict way. (The extent to which Parliamentary statute applied to the colonies, beyond the extent to which Parliament could regulate the king's customs and military affairs, and whether Parliamentary statutes could themselves be reviewed, per Coke, and against what,were far more controversial issues, and played a leading role in the Revolution). As a practical matter, Americans also got in the habit of conducting judicial review of statutes, and thus in contrast to English judges acquired much practical experience at the task. Judicial review of statutes is not something one immediately learns to do once one thinks of the idea, and if one has not learned how to do it properly, it's easy to imagine why one would be opposed to the idea.Update, Sept. 14th 2006: Todd Zywicki has made similar points about case law, precedent, and the doctrine of stare decisis in his paper "The Rise and Fall of of Efficiency in Common Law: A Supply Side Analysis," available at SSRN.   Before the printing press, and to some extent for several centuries thereafter, case precedent was very hard to access through other than oral communications and was considered more or less authorattive according to a variety of factors rather than followed rigidly.  Thus stare decisis, the modern doctrine that courts must follow precedent, was not rigidly adhered to.  I'd also add something that Zywicki's account and my own research experience with medieval cases implies, namely that the the idea of "overturning" a case was unknown.  A contradictory older case could always be treated as more authoratitive than the more recent case, or vice versa, in parallel with the lack of a "last-in-time" rule for statute law.

My debate with Mike Huben on negative rights and the United States Constitution continues.  My basic thesis is that the substantive rights defined in the Bill of Rights and the Civil War Amendments, while often defined very broadly ("rights...retained by the people," "life, liberty, and property," "privileges and immunities," "equal protection of the laws," etc.) include only negative, and never positive, substantive rights.I have since made a second claim: that it continues to be the case that, when broadly defining basic human rights, positive rights are a very bad idea.  This is illustrated by our experience with some broad clauses in the constitutions of some States and some foreign nations defining positive rights (such as a "right to health care" or "right to education").  These clauses are naive and inherently vague, have led to endless debate, and have harmed rather than helped the economy in general and the poor in particular.
On ABC News Russell Tice, a former operator in the NSA's "special access" a.k.a. "black world" programs, estimates that the number of domestic-overseas calls "sucked into that vacuum" of the NSA's  illegal spy operation "could be in the millions."  "That vacuum" is an array of custom designed NSA supercomputers that scan massive numbers of phone calls for politically incorrect keywords.
Unenumerated welcomes two guest bloggers for this summer.   Mark Miller is a computer scientist who has been involved in the Xanadu hypertext project (a precursor of the Web), agoric computing projects, the E programming language, and much else.   Jon Roland is an expert on the U.S. Constitution and related legal topics. If you love Unenumerated, have some good ideas, and would like to guest blog this summer, please let me know.The fun new blog involves Mencius Moldbug and the political idea he calls "formalism", which bears some resemblance to the idea of property in everything.
ComputerWorld has a good article on what data they did and did not find on hotel card keys from various U.S. chains.  They generically claim that some European and older U.S. card key systems put personal information on hotel card keys, which could leave guests vulnerable to ID theft or other privacy violations.  The article's author, Robert L. Mitchell, concludes that current card keys used at major U.S. hotel and motel chains are OK, although in some cases they found data which they were unable to decode.

When we hear the word "authority" we often think of people who have set themselves up in positions of power and on whom we have become dependent. But there is another kind of authority, often more reliable and trustworthy, that can be provided by things. These are physical standards, security devices, automata, and other objects by which we coordinate our interactions with fellow humans, especially with strangers who might not otherwise be trustworthy. These technologies are crucial to our modern civilization and its ability to make dealings with strangers more secure and reliable.Authoritative automata often come in the form of what (on a computer) Mark Miller has dubbed an admonition system. An admonition system reminds a person of a plan or of a legal or ethical obligation. A clock, for example, can remind a person of a scheduled meeting, and a cash register communicates an obligation to pay.With some extra security a device may also provide a strong affordance that requires the person to act purposefully to use it or to avoid using it, and may also gather evidence of such use or avoidance, as with tamper evidence. A locked door, for example, reminds a person about whether they have consent to enter, makes accidental entry effectively impossible, and often requires those who enter anyway to leave behind evidence of lock picking or forcible entry.Some technologies create standards that we all come to follow, as in standard weights and measures. Old unforgeably costly standards, such as those of shells used in hunter-gatherer and Neolithic cultures and the gold standard used up to modern times, enabled the emergence of money to replace barter and other costly and inconvenient in-kind transactions. Physical standards provide objective, verifiable, and repeatable interactions with our physical environment and with each other.When new kinds of authoritative automata are proposed, the robotic response of Hello Kitty people is that they are inflexible and impersonal and thus not to be trusted. The Roman playwright Plautus made fun of early complainer of this kind, a bum objecting to one of the earliest authoritative devices, the sundial: The gods confound the man who first found outHow to distinguish the hours. Confound him too,Who in this place set up a sundial,To cut and hack my days so wretchedlyInto small pieces! When I was a boy,My belly was my sundial -- only surer,Truer, and more exact than any of them.This dial told me when 'twas the proper timeTo go to dinner, when I ought to eat;But nowadays, why even when I have,I can't fall to unless the sun gives leave.The town's so full of these confounded dials!But history teaches that it is the many people who act strategically against strangers who are not to be trusted. It is human preferences, not machines, that are unpredictable and incomparable, as well they should be. For coordinating our interactions with strangers, impartial automata are often crucial.To what extent will computer algorithms come to serve as authorities? We've already seen one algorithm that has been in use for centuries: the adding algorithm in adding machines and cash registers. Some other authoritative algorithms have become crucial parts of the following:(1) All the various protocols network applications use to talk to each other, such the web browser protocol you are probably using right now,(2) The system that distributes domain names (the name of a web site found in an URL) and translate them to Internet protocol (IP) addresses -- albeit, not the ability to register domain names in the first place, which is still largely manual,(3) Ranking algorithms such as Google page rank (for relevance based on a particular text search) and popularity ranking algorithms such as those used by Digg, Reddit, and the like,(4) Payment systems, such as credit card processing and PayPal,(5) Time distribution networks and protocols,(6) The Global Positioning System (GPS) for determining location based on the time it takes radio signals to travel from a orbiting satellites, and(7) A wide variety of other algorithms that many of us rely on to coordinate our activities.Algorithms give us the potential of moving beyond the weak and reactive security of most physical devices to strong and often preventative security. Technologies such as digital signatures and mulitparty private computation may be used to implement things like unalterable audit trails, smart contracts, secure and owner-controlled property title registries, and so on. Bit gold, or property titles to unforgeably costly bits, might be possible. These automata will rely more on distribution and protocol security and less on trusted third parties than traditional authorities. There is a strong argument to be made that algorithmic authorities should be open source.We've just scratched the surface of what secure authorities we can establish over computer networks. Such authorities will make it far easier for 6 billion plus strangers to interact with each other securely and reliably.
Often in political parlance the phrase "the market" is used quite broadly to cover a wide variety of voluntary economic institutions, including firms, non-profit organizations, families, and so on in addition to markets proper.  But traditional neoclassical economics is about ideal markets proper: instantaneous buying and selling on a costless spot exchange.  Ronald Coase started expanding the scope of economics with his work on the firm, and this line of thinking has developed into a school, often called the "new institutional economics" or NIE that focuses on non-market or partial-market voluntary economic institutions as well as on the conditions that must be satisfied for efficient markets to be possible.   The economics Nobel committee has finally recognized the study of non-market but voluntary economic institutions with its awards this year to Oliver Williamson and Elinor Ostrom.Williamson and his fellow travelers Oliver Hart, Yoram Barzel, Steven Cheung, and Janet Landa have long influenced my thinking about measuring value, mental transaction costs, smart contracts, the origins of money, and more.The new institutional economics school in a nutshell holds that often transaction costs are too high for spot markets to work properly.   If spot markets were perfectly efficient we would not need firms or long-term contracts, for example, but in fact we have those and many other institutions besides pure markets.   The NIE studies and has started to explain the functions of institutions that are not markets proper, such as long-term contracts and firms, as well as the legal underpinnings of market economies, especially property and contracts.   Contracts and property are the main formal expressions of economic relations recognized by the NIE, which makes this school especially interesting to someone like me interested in the economic role of contracts and property and how to adapt these institutions to (and even to some extent incorporate them into) evolving technology.Note that these institutions are "voluntary" in the sense of the traditional common-law principle of non-initiation of force, and assume a sophisticated legal framework. When this assumption doesn't hold, these principles usually work in a very different way or don't work at all, and one has to be very careful applying them.  (See here and here for more on the problem of coercive externalities).Meanwhile, here is a good article introducing the other economics Nobel winner this year, Elinor Ostrom.
 Archaeologists report in this week's Science that they have found shell beads in Algeria and Israel dating back to about 90,000 and 100,000 BP respectively. Humans drilled holes in the mollusc shells which would have allowed them to be strung as beads on bracelets or necklaces. This pushes back the previously known earliest date from 75,00 BP. The shells are from the same marine species as the 75,000 BP shells found in South Africa, suggesting a very conservative or stereotyped tradition (as is also the case for stone work dating this far back). The wide geographical spread suggests origins much earlier than even 100,000 BP. Furthermore, the Algerian shells were found in a cave about 200 km from the ancient shoreline, indicating long distance distribution (whether via trade or other transactions or just transport) of either the unworked shells, the beads, or both.As I have previously explained, while these objects undoubtedly may have served some symbolic purposes, they were neither merely nor primarily symbolic. These necklaces were objects whose monetary properties, such as unforgeable costliness, divisibility, and security, were optimized given the available technologies (i.e. no metal working). These objects, which I have called "collectibles," differ from modern views of money only in two basic ways:* They differ from many modern legal definitions of "money" (e.g. that of the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code) insofar as they were not minted or authorized by sovereign governments, hunter-gatherer societies having no such entities.* Their primary uses were not for market exchange. Rather, by solving the double (or more) coincidence of wants problem, they solved more basic cooperation problems of kin altruism, reciprocal altruism, and the mitigation of aggression, and thus gained homo sapiens -- perhaps we should be called homo monetarius -- an important evolutionary advantage over homo neanderthalensis and other animals. This is probably also reflected in the human instinct to collect shells and other bright objects, an instinct not found in other primates and an instinct which would have allowed us to gain these advantages in cooperation over other animals.Again my thanks to Ian Grigg for the pointer to this latest news.
The EPA has an interesting report on the cap-and-trade programs for acid rain pollutants. These markets have led to dramatic reductions in the pollutants while costing industry (and therefore consumers) relatively little. This is reflected by the fact that electricity prices have also fallen since the advent of the acid rain pollution markets. Anybody who is serious about reduction of large-scale pollution from large sources sees cap and trade as the leading method of reduction. The program has been so successful the EPA has been able to set new ambitious goals of reducing sulfates by a further 70% and nitrates by a further 60% without serious objection from Republicans.The next big challenge is carbon dioxide, the probable main cause of global warming. The European Union Emission Trading Scheme is the first stab at this. According to critics the European authority has given away too many grandfathered credits and bought too few back, causing the price to decline too far and, allegedly, too few actual emissions reductions to be implemented. While emission markets themselves work remarkably well, where the actual cap of emissions should be set remains a political hot button.    Fortunately, the pollution market also makes it far easier to far more accurately estimate cost-benefit ratios, thus greatly informing the political debate.Besides the cap level, the most interesting debate is over auctions versus grandfathering for allocating the initial rights. While the U.S. acid rain market achieved great results with grandfathering the initial credits, it's probable that emissions markets would work even better by auctioning off the inititial credits rather than giving them away based on current emissions. Grandfathering creates an incentive for polluters to increase their emissions in the years befor the grandfathering levels are determined. On the other hand, there's an argument to be made that current emitters have by their legal operations developed prescriptive rights to their current levels of emissions, and the acid rain markets have demonstrated that grandfathering works.The U.S. market also shows that it takes some time to develop these market institutions. An initial dry-run period which focuses more on developing the market and monitoring institutions rather than steep carbon dioxide reductions is probably a good idea. Once the institutions have evolved into an efficient form dramatic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from large sources will likely be possible, as indicated by the EPA now being able target dramatic reductions after a decade of acid rain emissions trading.The third interesting issue is whether to include third party carbon dioxide sinks in the market. This would be a novelty not yet tried in other pollution markets, but it makes quite a bit of sense since we don't really know yet whether emissions reduction or creating carbon dioxide sinks is the better strategy for carbon dioxide reduction.   The market should motivate both solutions.  But measuring the amount of carbon dioxide sunk, and determining for how long a period into the future it must be sunk for, are among the novel issues to be addressed.The fourth issue, crucial to getting carbon dioxide markets to actually cut back the rising global emissions, is to extend them to other developed countries and, most challenging of all, to developing countries. 
Anno Domini 193 is often called the Year of the Five Emperors after the five that ruled as princeps ("first citizen") in all or major parts of the Roman Empire: Pertinax, Didianus Julianus, Pescennius Niger, Clodius Albinus, and Septimus Severus.   Indeed, counting the Emperor Commodus, who died at the end of 192, the Empire saw six emperors in the space of five months.The Roman imperial succession was supposed to proceed by adoption of the most competent possible successor [3].  This followed the example of Julius Caesar's adoption of Octavian as his heir, and Octavian's subsequent taking on the title of princeps as Augustus Caesar. In practice, however, at least three other factors often intervened: first, emperors tended to favor their natural sons over their adopted ones; second, the Praetorian Guard, the emperor's bodyguard, often exercised a life-or-death control over the succession; and third, Roman legions were often motivated to intervene.   Combining this rickety system of succession with the awful power of the autocratic emperor, whose "will was law", made successions an all-or-nothing, win-or-die struggle of often devastating violence.  The Year of the Five Emperors witnessed more than its share of such violence.  It gave rise to the Severan dynasty and more importantly to its legal authorities, who are cited in courts of law today, millenia after the emperors themselves have been forgotten.  The Severan's jurists also voiced political ideas that would echo down to our time, as we shall see in future articles.Commodus, the incompetent and unpopular natural son and successor of Marcus Aurelius, was poisoned by his mistress Marcia (not, I'm afraid to tell fans of Gladiator, slain by Russell Crowe in the Colosseum).   Apparently this assassination was a plot that included the Praetorian prefect Laetus and the urban prefect Pertinax.  The urban prefect was something like the mayor of the city of Rome: he supervised all the collegia (corporations and guilds) in the city, supervised maintenance of its aqueducts and sewers, supervised the import and doling of grain, supervised a force of police and night watchmen, and other such administrative tasks.  The Praetorian prefect was the head of the emperor's bodyguard, the Praetorian Guard, which also (as here) often had the power to make or break emperors.The Guard declared Pertinax emperor.  After only three months in power, as the great historian Cassius Dio reports, the Praetorians, unsatisfied with the funds Pertinax had provided them and fearing persecution, turned against Pertinax:But Laetus...proceeded to put out of the way many of the soldiers, pretending that it was by the emperor's orders. The others, when they became aware of it, feared that they, too, should perish, and made a disturbance; but two hundred, bolder than their fellows, actually invaded the palace with drawn swords. Pertinax had no warning of their approach until they were already up on the hill; then his wife rushed in and informed him of what had happened. On learning this he behaved in a manner that one will call noble, or senseless, or whatever one pleases. For, even though he could in all probability have killed his assailants,— as he had in the night-guard and the cavalry at hand to protect him, and as there were also many people in the palace at the time,— or might at least have concealed himself and made his escape to some place or other, by closing the gates of the palace and the other intervening doors, he nevertheless adopted neither of these courses. Instead, hoping to overawe them by his appearance and to win them over by his words, he went to meet the approaching band, which was already inside the palace; for no one of their fellow-soldiers had barred the way, and the porters and other freedmen, so far from making any door fast, had actually opened absolutely all the entrances.[1]The soldiers dispatched Pertinax and the Praetorians then decided to make their pecuniary preferences far more clear before they chose the next emperor: Meanwhile Didius Julianus, at once an insatiate money-getter and a wanton spendthrift, who was always eager for revolution and hence had been exiled by Commodus to his native city of Mediolanum, now, when he heard of the death of Pertinax, hastily made his way to the camp, and, standing at the gates of the enclosure, made bids to the soldiers for the rule over the Romans. Then ensued a most disgraceful business and one unworthy of Rome.  For, just as if it had been in some market or auction-room, both the City and its entire empire were auctioned off. The sellers were the ones who had slain their emperor, and the would-be buyers were Sulpicianus and Julianus, who vied to outbid each other, one from the inside, the other from the outside.  They gradually raised their bids up to twenty thousand sesterces per soldier. Some of the soldiers would carry word to Julianus, "Sulpicianus offers so much; how much more do you make it?" And to Sulpicianus in turn, "Julianus promises so much; how much do you raise him?"  Sulpicianus would have won the day, being inside and being prefect of the city and also the first to name the figure twenty thousand, had not Julianus raised his bid no longer by a small amount but by five thousand at one time, both shouting it in a loud voice and also indicating the amount with his fingers. So the soldiers, captivated by this excessive bid and at the same time fearing that Sulpicianus might avenge Pertinax (an idea that Julianus put into their heads), received Julianus inside and declared him emperor.[1]  But this was politics, not voluntary commerce, and the military hierarchy of the Roman legions proved to be mightier than the highest bidder.  Three governors (commanding several legions each), Albinus of Britain, Severus of Pannonia (south-central Europe), and Niger of Syria, declared themselves emperor, suspended forwarding of tax revenues to Rome, and started marching on Rome to dethrone what they considered to be a corruptly selected emperor.  Severus got there first:Severus, after winning over everything in Europe except Byzantium, was hastening against Rome.   He did not venture outside the protection of arms, but having selected his six hundred most valiant men, he passed his time day and night in their midst; these did not once put off their breastplates until they were in Rome.[1] The security precautions of the Praetorians proved to be no match for Severus' legions, and this was so obvious that the city and Praetorian rank-and-file basically rebelled against Didianus Julianus and the Praetorian leaders and turned the city and the emperorship over to Severus:Julianus, on learning of [Severus' approach to Rome], caused the senate to declare Severus a public enemy, and proceeded to prepare against him. In the suburbs he constructed a rampart, provided with gates, so that he might take up a position out there and fight from that base.  The city during these days became nothing more nor less than a camp, in the enemy's country, as it were. Great was the turmoil on the part of the various forces that were encamped and drilling,— men, horses, and elephants,— and great, also, was the fear inspired in the rest of the population by the armed troops, because the latter hated them.  Yet at times we would be overcome by laughter;he Pretorians did nothing worthy of their name and of their promise, for they had learned to live delicately; the sailors summoned from the fleet stationed at Misenum did not even know how to drill; and the elephants found their towers burdensome and would not even carry their drivers any longer, but threw them off, too.  But what caused us the greatest amusement was his fortifying of the palace with latticed gates and strong doors. For, inasmuch as it seemed probable that the soldiers would never have slain Pertinax so easily if the doors had been securely locked, Julianus believed that in case of defeat he would be able to shut himself up there and survive. But Severus presently reached Italy, and took possession of Ravenna without striking a blow. Moreover, the men whom Julianus kept sending against him, either to persuade him to turn back or to block his advance, were going over the Severus' side;  and the Pretorians, in whom Julianus reposed most confidence, were becoming worn out by their constant toil and were becoming greatly alarmed at the report of Severus' near approach. At this juncture Julianus called us together and bade us appoint Severus to share his throne.  But the soldiers, convinced by letters of Severus that if they surrendered the slayers of Pertinax and themselves kept the peace they would suffer no harm, arrested the men who had killed Pertinax, and announced this fact to Silius Messalla, who was then consul.  The latter assembled us in the Athenaeum, so named from the educational activities that were carried on in it, and informed us of the soldiers' action. We thereupon sentenced Julianus to death, named Severus emperor, and bestowed divine honours on Pertinax. And so it came about that Julianus was slain as he was reclining in the palace itself; his only words were, "But what evil have I done? Whom have I killed?" He had lived sixty years, four months, and the same number of days, out of which he had reigned sixty-six days.[1]Severus "inflicted the death penalty" on the plotters against Pertinax and "murdered" a number of Senators, after swearing a sacred oath not to harm any Senators. (The quoted language is Cassius Dio's [2] in translation).   So what were Severus' homicides -- legal executions or illegal murders?  This was question of legal procedure.  Under the old Republican legal tradition, still nominally enforce but in practice long defunct where the emperor was concerned, most of these killings would have been considered extrajudicial, i.e. murders.  As we shall see, under the laws codified under the Severan dynasty, "the emperor's will was law" -- he by definition could never murder, only execute, and his oaths were by definition not binding on his future self.Major civil war ensued as the Severan legions went up against those of Albinus and Niger.  The terrific battles included a spectacular siege of Byzantium -- later to become Constantnople, but already a mighty fortress strategically placed within on the Bosporus, controlling the maritime traffic between the Mediterranean and Black Seas.   After four years of civil war between Roman legions [3], Severus came out the winner.  I will examine the reign of the Severan dynasty, and in particular the effects of military structure of the victorious legions on the political structure and legal procedures of Rome, in subsequent posts.References[1] and [2] Cassius Dio, Roman History, books [1] 74 and [2] 75.[3] Tony Honore, Ulpian, Oxford University Press (second edition 2002).
Many years of government debt buildup in Greece has ultimately resulted, in the last few days, in a political and financial maelstrom.  The political maelstrom includes demonstrations in the run up to a referendum on obscure debt-restructuring provisions to be held this Sunday (July 5th). This article focuses on  financial problems and some potential practical steps that can be taken to mitigate them. The imposition of capital controls is a disaster for a modern trade-driven economy, a catastrophe which however digital technology, and in particular the digital currency bitcoin (which given the Greek environment usually must involve direct use of the Bitcoin blockchain), has the potential to mitigate.  This article will explore some of the severe practical problems that capital controls are causing Greek individuals and businesses, and suggest some potential bitcoin solutions, many of which could also be applied to other countries with some similar financial problems and controls such as Argentina and Venezuela.  These aren't solutions that can be applied in time to help with the current 6 days of capital controls, but could substantially help some Greeks and some aspects of the Greek economy if some version of these controls is continued for months or years.At root the Greek financial problem is that the Greek government has spent more, compared to the GDP generated by its economy, than the vast majority of other governments.  It has borrowed copious sums to do so, falling ever deeper into debt.  Here is its payment schedule:And you thought your student loan debt was badThe only place the Greek government has left to go for money to fund its ongoing expenditures and pay these debts is Greek banks.  Fearing capital controls and "haircuts" (government confiscation of certain fractions of bank deposits), many Greeks in recent months have, quite rationally, started withdrawing money out of their banks and sending it overseas.  More trusting Greeks kept their savings in their banks, with the result that, with the imposition of capital controls last Monday, they have been locked out of their savings, and plans for "haircuts" of 30% or more have been reported (If somebody lopped off 30% of your head, you’d have more than a haircut).When capital controls were first rumored and then announced on Sunday, vast lines formed at ATMs as Greeks rushed to rescue what little of their life savings that they could:ATM line, ThessalonikiATM line, Larissa CityOn Tuesday, the Greek government defaulted on its scheduled debt payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Under capital controls, ATM withdrawals from Greek bank accounts are now limited to 60 euros a day.  Debit cards can still be used for payments within the country, but the money simply gets transferred from one frozen bank account to another.  As a result many businesses no longer accept debit cards, and many more are demanding a substantial premium price (in  at least one business, double) for debit cards (transferred bank balances) versus hard cash.  There is a growing shortage of such cash; as a result some stores are paying their suppliers in private "scrip", which can be used by the supplier's workers to purchase goods from the issuing store. (more on this below).Use of credit and debit cards to pay out of the country is banned and effectively blocked, resulting in a near-complete freeze-out of Greeks from Internet commerce. This restriction, along with the controls resulting in Greeks being excluded from the pan-European money settlement system, means that Greek businesses can't pay for imports.  Many shipments into the country have been halted as a result. (The government plan is to create a whitelist of politically approved cases in which such payments for imports will be unblocked).A crucial feature of store-issued scrip is that it literally circulates through a complete closed cycle: store --> supplier --> workers --> store.  Such specific cycles are a pattern that is commonly found when currencies are primitive or newly emerging, and every Bitcoin marketer and evangelist should be familiar with them. The kula ring, two specific cycles (counter-circulating cycles of shell money) allowing exchange of seasonal goods in the precolonial South PacificIt doesn’t help much to sell bitcoin to isolated individuals: as a mere store of value its volatility is much greater than most existing currencies; as an investment it only makes sense as a tiny high-risk fraction of one's portfolio.  Bitcoin does have some political-affinity and status value in developed countries; by contrast in many developing countries and in countries under financial crisis such as Greece, there are urgent needs bitcoin potentially can address.  In terms of these needs Bitcoin is mainly useful as a way to send money across borders for investment in more stable assets overseas, and to substitute for cash or other substitute currencies in a money-starved environment.To have value as a medium of exchange, bitcoin must be taken up by a community of people who already frequently trade with each other,  and who have a strong need to use it in these trades. It is especially important to market to the links in the cycle that have the strongest negotiating leverage with the others (in the case of Greek the Greek store scrip cycle, the store and its larger suppliers).  The link in the cycle with the greatest incentives to switch to bitcoin here are likely the store's suppliers, because they don’t fully trust the store, nor the underlying currency, euro or post-euro, that is the “O” in an IOU, but are participating in the scrip because, sans bitcoin, they have no other choice.In bitcoin specific cycles create other cost savings.  Almost everywhere they economize on the increasingly high KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money-laundering) costs of going through a fiat-bitcoin exchange.  What's more, in a capital controls environment like Greece specific cycles avoid the capital controls that would be imposed on a Greek-based fiat-bitcoin exchange, and avoid the need nearly all Greek customers using out-of-country exchanges would have to futilely try to tap into their frozen bank accounts in order to purchase bitcoin. Bitcoin will not, contrary to some feverish news reporting, help Greeks get money out of their frozen bank accounts.But bitcoin does have great potential to help in less obvious ways: for one thing, as a superior (not vulnerable to trust in an issuing store, and in any currency underlying an IOU) substitute for the emerging store scrips.  For another, it could help greatly with the severe cross-border commerce issues that are emerging.  Exporters, including freelancers working over the Internet, can bring bitcoin into the country, thereby avoiding earning wages that get deposited to frozen bank accounts (per Greek lore, be wary of a cave with many tracks coming in but few coming out). Importers can pay for goods with bitcoin while other electronic payment channels (European money settlements, Paypal, and credit & debit cards when paying foreign businesses, etc.) remain frozen. Again specific cycles must be set up: isolated marketing to just exporters or importers will be far less effective than organizing existing supply chains that involve both.There are likely many other, mostly highly non-obvious, niches in which bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, and smart contract platforms could play a quite valuable role in capital-controlled and other financially handicapped countries.Bitcoin is not easy to learn, either conceptually or in setting up businesses and individuals with the software (and preferably also the secure hardware) to accept it. This is especially the case in a capital controls climate where the traditional bitcoin exchanges and retail payment companies, with their consumer-friendly front ends, as they normally operate in developed countries, likely can't effectively operate. To take advantage of bitcoin many Greeks will have to use the Bitcoin blockchain directly. So it's too late for bitcoin to help much with the current 6 days of bank closure,  but once the learning curves have been surmounted, the participants in specific cycles educated, bitcoin has great potential to address likely many ongoing problems with capital control, in Greece as long as they continue in various forms, and in many other parts of the world where such financial restrictions designed for a pre-digital era have been imposed.[Update: various minor edits: the first version was rather rough, sorry :-)] 
Danielle Citron has written an interesting article on liability for leaks of data like social security numbers (SSNs) that many organizations use as authenticators. Use of such weak authenticators increasingly results in failed (i.e. false) authentication ("identity theft") that harms a victim by imputing to that victims debts or bad credit history. Citron argues that the handling of such "personal data," like the reservoirs in Rylands v. Fletcher, should be deemed an "ultrahazardous activity", and thus that those who handle personal data should be held strictly liable for any damages caused in fact by the handling of that data (in particular, by leaks of that data subsequently used by "cyber-criminals" to harm a victim).There are several things wrong with Citron's analysis:(1) Strict liability, like other forms of liability, is generally limited by proximate cause. Indeed, I've never heard of strict liability coupled to mere cause-in-fact. If there is a data leak by Trent that enables Mallet to falsely authenicate himself as Bob, which failed authentication is then depended on by Alice resulting in harm to Bob, both Mallet and Alice are intermediate causes of Bob's harm. There is thus cause-in-fact but no proximate cause between Trent's data leak and the harm to Bob. Indeed, the typical identity theft involves a chain of causation quite remote from the data leaker and thus far beyond where courts have ever dared to tread. This is in sharp contrast to the completely unmediated causes in all previous ultrahazardous activity strict liability regimes.The case Citron cites about the landlord being held liable for the harm of an assault inside his property arose as she states under negligence, not strict liability. Furthermore it was a rare exception, it is not the rule. In most states this would go the other way. The same issue of intermediate cause has rendered futile attempts to hold gun sellers responsible for crimes committed with their guns. The relation between the typical data merchant and the person referred to in the data is far more distant than the landlord/tenant relationship. Even the gun seller is fewer intermediate causes away from the harm of a typical murder than an SSN leaker is to the harm of a typical identity theft victim. Quite often the origin of the identity thief's false authenticator simply cannot be established, whereas the organization that depended on the false authenticator and proximately caused bad credit or false debt is well known.(2) The article assumes data held by trusted central authorities who have the ability to protect this data at a relatively low cost, and that if they cannot protect it then society could do without the activity. The first assumption is questionable given the existence of tiny data fobs and many other ways to steal or accidentally lose data beyond the control of the organization. Citron debunks the second assumption herself by pointing out how ubiquitous and how important the use of such data is.Furthermore, just about every organization in our society, and many individuals, handle data which could be used to harm people. It's hard to imagine articulating a rule clear enough (by, say, restricting it to specific kinds of data such as SSNs) to cover most of the risks, yet to put the risks on the major data brokers in particular but not on the rest of us. If strict liability is restricted to certain poor authenticators (e.g. SSNs) but not others (e.g. legal names), data brokers and authenticators will simply switch their activities to use the non-covered authenticators, which are often even weaker, the result being even greater levels of identity theft.(3) Citron does not provide a clear set of rules, but clear and complely objective rules, and methods for gathering unambiguous evidence of violations, are crucial for a regime of strict liability.(4) A much better alternative is to let liability lie on organizations that use information known to be widely distributed and often leaked, such as SSNs, as authenticators, and on organizations or individuals who most proximately cause the harm of identity theft -- those who even in good faith falsely report the victim's name to a credit bureau or try to collect a false debt from the victim that was incurred by depending on a false authentication of the victim. These situations are far more analogous to the landlord case -- like the landlord, they have established a relationship with victim; at least they have after falsely reporting the victim's name to a credit bureau or trying to collect a false debt from the victim. Indeed they are more proximate to the victim than even the identity thief: the thief fraudulently used the victim's authenticators, but the thief was not the party that directly harmed the victim by putting the false information on the victim's credit report or by attempting to collect a debt the victim did not in fact incur.(5) Citron's "data reservoir" metaphor is facially attractive, but as with most physical metaphors applied to information it is highly misleading. The "water" (data) leaking here causes no obvious direct damage like a flood. Rather when data leaks it does not cause any damage until it is used by other parties, like water being used for irrigation. Applying Citron's reasoning to the latest e. coli contaminated spinach harm, Citron would make liable not the immediate seller of the spinach, nor the packager, nor even the grower who used the contaminated water. Instead Citron would put the liability on the rancher whose cattle produced the e. coli in the first place, even though e. coli is inevitable ingredient of manure and thus an inevitable part of ranching activity. Citron's strict liability rule would brinig the entire business of cattle ranching to an end. Just the same, in a world of laptops and fobs and a variety of other conduits, data leaks are an inevitable part of the indispensible business of handling data, and Citron's rue would devastatingly bring this business to an end.Bottom line: liability should be put on the low-cost avoider. This is not merely a rule of negligence but a guideline for determining where any kind of liability should fall in any new area of commerce. The idea that the data brokers are the low cost avoiders in this system is highly implausible. Rather, here as with most other harms, it is those parties most proximate to the harm who can most easily prevent it. Furthermore, the evidence needed to hold parties liable will be far more reliably available for the proximate harmer than the remote data leaker.Organizations that use widely distributed and easily leaked data like SSNs as authenticators, and who currently depend on such weak authentications for credit reporting and debt collection, can switch to more secure passwords at lower costs than would be imposed by Citron's regime. Organizations that fail to use secure authenticators, especially organizations that report information to credit bureaus or attempt to collect debts based on insecure authenticators, should bear the liability for identity theft due to the known insecurity of those authenticators, rather than organizations who inevitably leak already widely distributed data.H/T: Emergent Chaos.
I have written about how the productivity of property, and the institutions associated with that property, have tended to be greatly improved when that property was more secure from military and poor quality political intervention (and how these two interventions were often related). Societies dominated by different kinds of property thus have formed different kinds of political and legal structures. For example, modern states whose economies are dominated by the extraction of oil and other minerals tend to have strong governments, and correspondingly less freedom and democracy, especially when (as now) the prices of those mineral deposits are high, probably because mineral extraction tends to be dominated by up-front rather than operational costs, making it easy for governments to expropriate the bulk of the surplus.Although farming dominated most economies until modern times, medieval city republics produced a large number of crucial innovations and had a profound influence on the modern world. Examples included Venice, Genoa, and the Hanseatic League. These republics were focused on cities and their economies were dominated by goods (primarily their storage and transport, but also manufacturing) rather than by farming. As a result, they evolved a set of unique institutions and a unique form of government, the corporate republic. These republics were generally focused on cities that secured their goods, markets, and persons on islands or behind steep mountains. These medieval republics developed a wide variety of institutional innovations, such as insurance and the corporate republican form of government, which are crucial to our modern era.Illustrations: Genoa (top) and Venice (above), foci of the two most extensive, powerful, and innovative city republics of medieval Europe.
I have a beautful private collection of bank notes from the Free Banking Era in the United States (1837-1863).  During this era the U.S. had no central bank and paper money was issued by a variety of private banks.  Some was even issued by manufacturing and retail companies.  This money was backed by gold, silver, real estate, stocks, bonds, and a wide variety of other assets.  You can no longer cash them in, but they are now worth often substantial sums as collectibles.  As you can see below, the note designs were more varied and creative than modern money, and were remarkably free of politicians' faces.  Due to personal cash flow needs, I am selling some of my collection.  Nobody is printing any more of this kind of money and it is a great hedge against inflation.  As a collectible it is subject to less political risk than gold (recall FDR's confiscation of gold in the U.S., for example) or commodities (just watch C-SPAN to see what politicians want to do to commodities "speculators"). If you want to shop around, Google for what other people are asking.  Make sure you're looking at fresh prices though -- as you might imagine, along with commodities and many other collectibles their dollar prices have risen substantially over the past year.

There is a problem in what name to give the topic of this post. Perhaps the best name is "digital private law," but this might invoke in the mind of the reader laws passed by politicians to regulate private computers, and that is practically the opposite of the meaning intended. Instead, our topic is digital code that augments or even replaces the functions of traditional private law: contracts, property, torts, etc. -- i.e. almost any law that is traditionally settled in a private lawsuit rather than by a criminal prosecution. Since most of the inspiration so far has come from the English legal tradition, it might also be called "digital common law." Or we might simply call it "smart law" in parallel with coinages like "smart weapons" and "smart contracts."  Or "law in a box" or "law on your lap."  Mark Miller has captured the spirit, with perhaps some utopian exaggeration, with his slogan, "computer security is the future of law." Lawrence Lessig has colorfully called such digital code "west coast code" (drafted by hackers in Silicon Valley and Seattle) in contrast to "east coast code" (drafted by lawyers in Washington, D.C.) This short-shrifts the many talented east coast computer programmers and west coast lawyers, not to mention all overseas lawyers and programmers. But it helps to clarify my topic by noting that it corresponds to Lessig's "west coast code."Digital private law is also private law in the sense that contracts, property deeds, wills, and so on are private law. In contrast to statutes, regulations, and judicial precedents, they are drafted by private persons rather than politicians or government bureaucrats. Of course, governments could also draft digital code for private use (either voluntary or compulsory), but in the absence of a strong need for a trusted third party to enforce the rules -- which digital security codes can greatly reduce -- there will be much less need for this than there is for governments to operate courts, police forces, armed forces and the like to enforce traditional law and beat up on plenty of innocent people in the process. Digital private law replaces, where appropriate, the threat of violence, and both the flexibility and corruptibility of human judgment, with the utterly peaceful and predictable -- but at times naive, adhesive, strict, and harsh -- operation of digital code.Digital private law, smart contracts, and the like are metaphors (using traditional legal code as a model for digital code), but they are also much more than metaphors -- such code can augment and increasingly, in some cases, will come to replace traditional legal code. They take the form of network protocols inspired by legal metaphors and implementing some of the functions that law has or could serve.Smart contracts allow a new freedom of contract that is no longer possible, if it ever was, with traditional law. Secure property titles will allow more secure and more fine-grained recording and transfer of property rights, while RFIDs are enhancing and proplets will further enhance the protection of those rights. In general, digital security protocols, especially advanced cryptography, allow radically enhanced or utterly new kinds of security that were impossible and unthinkable, and indeed seem quite magical, from the perspective of traditional law and paper security. The raw power of computer to crunch numbers, combined with artful new ways to draw preferences from users and represent them digitally, may also overcome the mental transaction cost barrier to very complex terms and very fine-grained transactions, opening up a potentially large new economic space now crudely occupied by resource allocation algorithms.Besides digital security and user interface design, the theory of digital private law involves much economics, not coincidentally of the law-and-economics kind -- ideas drawn from this area such as transaction costs, value measurement costs, the low-cost avoider, and so on loom large in thinking about these protocols.I have thought of and sketched many digital protocols which demonstrate some of these new possibilities. Often I have taken protocols from advanced cryptography that were naively described in narrow terms (e.g. "digital cash") and described them in their full potential generality as substitutes for traditional commercial forms (e.g. "digital bearer instruments"). Sometimes I have described some utterly new possibilities (e.g. confidential auditing). Here are some of the highlights, roughly categorized by the area of law the protocols draw inspiration from -- which also contain the functions of law they intend to serve:Property law"Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority""Proplets"Contract Law"The Idea of Smart Contracts""Smart Contracts Reduce Mental Transaction Costs""Smart Contracts Expand Credit Opportunities""From Vending Machines to Smart Contracts""Scarce Objects and Market Translators"Banking and Payment Systems"Contracts with Bearer""Bit Gold""Micropayments Redux""Combine Tipping with Aggregators"Tort law"Robot Law"Corporate Law"Confidential Auditing""Patterns of Integrity"I've also written on some general theoretical considerations:"Security and the Burden of Lawsuit" -- how computer security augments and interacts with traditional law"Wet Code and Dry" -- On the strong distinctions, as well as similarities, between traditional legal code and digital code"Things as Authorities" -- Digital private law will inherent the often authoritative nature of technology in human relationships"Multiparty Secure Computation" -- a very powerful and general protocol that can provide radically new privacy functions enabling confidential bid auctions, confidential auditing, etc.Even all this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Our Constitution, while admirable in many respects, has some deep flaws, especially the federal court structure.  But given the flawed court structure, it has developed one very redeeming feature: the Incorporation Doctrine.  Under this doctrine, said by the Supreme Court to be implied from the 14th Amendment clause requiring States to respect due process, the federal Bill of Rights is applied as a limitation on States.   This doctrine has allowed federal courts to enforce many individual rights against state governments, which state courts have far less incentive to do, even though similar or the same rights are written into most state constitutions.  Combined with the doctrine that the Bill of Rights means the same thing when applied to States as they do when applied against the federal government, (the Same-Scope Doctrine -- an assumption that on original meaning grounds is perhaps flawed), it has also given the federal courts far more incentive to enforce the Bill of Rights against the federal government itself.A brief further explanation of the basic flaws in both federal and state courts are in order.  These courts are selected by the legislatures and executive whose power they interpret.  This gives a strong selection bias (similar to adverse selection in economics, but involving the choices of third parties).   When on the bench, operational bias (analogous to moral hazard in economics) biases verdicts towards increasing both federal power and the rights of other parties as narrow exceptions to those powers in order to increase the number and importance of disputes, and thereby increase the importance of the federal courts.  The same logic applies to state courts interpreting the powers of state legislatures and executives under state constitutions. An example of selection bias at work: you will almost always see Senators ask judicial nominees their opinion on the Commerce Clause.  To be approved, the nominee cannot declare an intention to overturn preposterous interpretation by which "commerce among the States" includes growing marijuana or wheat in your own backyard for your own consumption.  If a nominee does not declare allegience to this legal monstrosity, which has vastly increased the power of the President and Senate, most Presidents and Senates will not allow him on the federal bench.  (The occassional joker, like Justice Thomas, does slip past both the President and Senate, but it's very rare).Before the Incorporation Doctrine and the same-scope assumption, federal courts rarely enforced the Bill of Rights against the federal government.  They enforced the small handful of limitations on the States in the original Constitution far more zealously.   The combination of selection and operational biases produces this result -- the federal courts want to inrease their influence by enforcing rights, but have to commit to Senators (and often the President) who select them to not enforce them strongly against federal legislative or executive acts.  They don't need to commit to States -- the States are not a source of selection bias -- so they can exercise their power freely by enforcing rights against the States.Thus the federal courts have always been eager to enforce individual rights against the States, but very reticent to do so against the federal government.  The Incorporation Doctrine and the same-scope assumption cause the federal courts to enforce the Bill of Rights against the federal government, going against their selection bias, as a price they are willing to pay to enforce a larger set of rights against the States.A much better solution for keeping governmental powers in check and rights protected would be to have federal courts interpret state constitutions, and set up a new super-federal court, selected completely independently of federal politicians, to interpret the U.S. Constitution.  Until such radical modification, the Incorporation and Same-Scope doctrines are crucial to incentivizing federal courts to enforce the Bill of Rights today.
Here's my paper on private jurisdiction in English history. Franchise jurisdiction played a crucial but unheralded role in the history of English law and politics. Some private jurisdictions existed in Anglo-Saxon times but they grew in importance in the Norman and Angevin periods, and in the corporate form remained an important part of the British Empire until the 20th century.A franchise, such as a corporation, a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was a kind of property: an "incorporeal hereditament." English property law was very flexible; as a result franchise jurisdictions came in a wide variety of forms. Franchise jurisdictions included those of manorial courts appurtenant to manors, secular courts appurtenant to ecclesiastical corporations (on top of the Church's own jurisdiction over family law), borough courts appurtenant to municipal corporations, merchant courts appurtenant to markets and fairs, and mining courts apputenant to mines and mining villages.For many substantive areas of law, the king's courts acted only as "night watchmen" courts that reviewed, not the substance of the case, but only whether the courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for trespass (tort) against the franchise court. Only if the franchise court was trespassing on the defendant (because it was not acting as a proper legal authority) or trespassing on the jurisdiction of the king or of another franchise court could the case be overturned. Development of the legal authority defense to trespass played a substantial role in developing many modern constitutional rights of procedure, such as the right to a jury trial. Under legal authority for trespass royal courts and officials were treated in basically the same way as franchise courts and officials. Thus, except for this "night watchmen" role of royal courts, where franchise courts and police had exclusive substantive jurisdiction the law operated in a peer-to-peer fashion via property relationships rather than in the hierarchical fashion via principle-agent or master-servant (employer-employee) relationships of imperial Rome and most modern court and police systems.Franchises could also be for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as "hundreds" (often like rural townships) and counties. Broad governmental powers, including almost all, and sometimes more, of the jurisdiction normally granted to royal common law and equity courts, were granted to counties Palatine and many colonial corporations (such as the East India Comany and the American colonies). The results, in terms of civil liberties, were quite varied.In English property law, land tenures and incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in charters in a form similar to the deeds of modern property law. When the charters involved large amounts of land with appurtenant military services and jurisdictions, they were political as well as economic in nature. These charters were the ancestors both of modern property deeds and of modern state and national constitutions.The Anglo-Norman legal idea of jurisdiction as property and peer-to-peer government clashed with ideas derived from the Roman Empire, via the text of Justinian's legal code and its elaboration in European universities, of sovereignty and totalitarian rule via a master-servant or delegation hierarchy. By the 20th century the Roman idea of hierarchical jurisdiction had largely won, especially in political science where government is often defined on neo-Roman terms as "sovereign" and "a monopoly of force." Our experience with totalitarianism of the 19th and 20th centuries, inspired and enabled by the Roman-derived procedural law and accompanying political structure (and including Napoleon, the Csars, the Kaisers, Communist despots, the Fascists, and the National Socialists), as well as the rise of vast and often oppressive bureaucracies in the "democratic" countries, should cause us to reconsider our commitment to government via master-servant (in modern terms, employer-employee) hierarchy, which is much bettter suited to military organization than to legal organization.Fortunately, franchise jurisdiction has left permanent influences on modern governments, including on the republican form of government in general and the United States Constitution, federalism, and procedural rights in particular. It also left a record of a wide variety of forms of law and government that can provide us with alternatives to the vast employee hierarchies weilding coercive powers that have given rise to modern oppression.
Proof of the Pythagorean theorem:Dark matter:Chemical reactions, fire, and photosynthesis:How trains stay on their tracks and go through turns:And just for fun, the broken window fallacy:
Under the franchise philosophy, jurisdictions and other organs of government large and small are property.  In a monarchic franchise system ownership of jurisdictional properties tends to be by individuals, whereas in a republican franchise system ownership of such properties tends to be by corporations.   There is no such thing as sovereignty or "the" government, but instead a wide variety of property rights to exercise specific political powers that may be bundled, or not, in a wide variety of ways.   The rights, duties, powers, and so on of persons in franchise systems are defined in property deeds, often called charters.In a franchise system, it follows that jurisdictional boundaries are a kind of property boundary.   This does not, however, mean that these boundaries should be treated in the same was as the popularly understand generic property in land is treated today.  For example, it does not automatically follow that one of their features should be a strict right of exclusion.Popularly we treat property in land as if it all came in one generic variety, but in fact properties (called in law "estates") can come in a wide variety of forms. There can be estates, sub-estates, and so on. There's no contradiction between having boundaries of larger properties and also having boundaries of smaller properties contained within them. And these boundaries can mean different things depending on the kind of estate involved. A jurisdictional estate can encompass a number of economic estates, for example, and the borders of each have different legal consequences.There is nothing more important to liberty than reducing exit costs. As Daniel Nagy points out in the debate at this link, this also argues towards reducing entrance costs -- although I do draw a distinction between the two.  Restrictions on their residents or guests leaving the property should be highly discouraged, and indeed generally constitute kidnapping. This should apply at any scale. Thus all forms of serfdom and national citizenship with restrictions on emigration that tie people to a territory, whether economic or jurisdictional, are highly destructive of liberty.The right of an owner to exclude people, on the other hand, should be very high for smaller properties and less so far larger (jurisdictional) properties. A jurisdictional property that restricts entrance also restricts the freedom of association of the jurisdiction's inhabitants. If a family desires to live and raise their children among "their own kind", whatever kind that is, the property policies or deeds that implement these associational preferences should be implement far more at a local level (for example with restrictive property deeds) than at a national level. Thus for example I favor the right to enforce discriminatory covenants on single lots and neighborhoods that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down under the fraudulent theory that these constitute "government action" and thus violate the Equal Protection Clause.  But on the scale of a large "nation" such as the United States, I am for open borders, unless the border restriction is due to a compelling reason of security that cannot be handled on a local scale.(This text is based on a comment I made in a prior post).Labels: borders, boundaries, emigration, exit costs, franchise, immigration, monarchy, property
The famous (among patent attorneys) U.S. claim construction case Phillips v. AWH may get even bigger if the Supreme Court decides to hear AWH's appeal.  AWH wants the Court to address the question of whether the Federal Circuit's review of claim interpretations on appeal should be done from scratch, which is the Federal Circuit's view, or with some degree of deference to the lower court's interpretation.  The Federal Circuit has been notorious for overturning over half of lower court interpretations of claims language.  This seems to imply a rather large degree of randomness in the way claims are interpreted.  My opinion is that this high uncertainty may be a consequence of the inherent difficulty of defining claims to chunks of technology "space".  If that's the case, deferring to the lower court would not make this uncertainty go away, it would simply hide it, giving to our patent laws a false sense of integrity.  Deference would at least make our arbitrary patent decisions more efficient.  Here are links to the briefs in front of the Court.  Harold Wegner says to expect the Court's decision on whether it will hear the case on February 21st.Meanwhile, the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office has decided an issue of law similar to that in the U.S. Metabolite case which is now in front of our Supreme Court.  The EPOs' decision will allow drafters of European patents to use, to some extent, the technique of gratuitous elements  in order to get around the ban European Patent Convention Article 52(4) places on patents for "diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body[.]"  European law also bans software patents, if you are foolish enough to believe the plain language of the statute.Today the Wall Street Journal has a good article on RIM v. NTP, where the U.S. Federal Circuit decided that a network system that would infringe a U.S. patent if entirely within the United States would also infringe a patent if one (at least) of the claim elements was located outside the United States but the users and thus the locus of control (so reasoned the court) were located within the United States.  However, for a similar method claim, all the steps of the procedure had to be performed within the United States in order for the procedure to infringe the method claim.  The WSJ's article is available today online.
From "Shelling Out: The Origins of Money":Evolutionary psychology starts with a key mathematical discovery of John Maynard Smith [D89]. Using models of populations of co-evolving genes, from the well-developed area of population genetics, Smith posited genes that can code for strategies, good or bad, used in simple strategic problems (the "games" of game theory). Smith proved that these genes, competing to be propagated into future generations, will evolve strategies that are Nash equilibria  to the strategic problems presented by the competition.  These games include the prisoner's dilemma, a prototypical problem of cooperation, and hawk/dove, a prototypical problem of aggression and its mitigation.Critical to Smith's theory is that these strategic games, while played out between phenotypes proximately, are in fact games between genes at the ultimate level -- the level of competition to be propagated. The genes -- not necessarily the individuals -- influence behavior as if they were boundedly rational (coding for strategies as optimal as possible, within the limits of what phenotypes can express given the biological raw materials and previous evolutionary history) and "selfish" (to use Richard Dawkins' metaphor). Genetic influences on behavior are adaptations to the social problems presented by genes competing through their phenotypes. Smith called these evolved Nash equilibria  evolutionary stable strategies..The "epicycles" built on top of the earlier individual selection theory, such as sexual selection and kin selection, disappear into this more general model which, in a Copernican manner, puts the genes rather than individuals at the center of the theory. Thus Dawkins' metaphorical and often misunderstood phrase, "selfish gene", to describe Smith's theory.Few other species cooperate on the order of even Paleolithic humans. In some cases -- brood care, the colonies of ants, termites, and bees, and so forth, animals cooperate because they are kin -- because they can help copies of their "selfish genes" found in their kin. In some highly constrained cases, there is also ongoing cooperation between non-kin, which evolutionary psychologists call reciprocal altruism. As Dawkins describes it [D89], unless an exchange of favors is simultaneous (and sometimes even then), one party or the other can cheat. And they usually do. This is the typical result of a game theorists call the Prisoner's Dilemna -- if both parties cooperated, both would be better off, but if one cheats, he gains at the expense of the sucker. In a population of cheaters and suckers, the cheaters always win. However, sometimes animals come to cooperate through repeated interactions and a strategy called Tit-for-Tat: start cooperating and keep cooperating until the other party cheats -- then defect yourself. This threat of retalation motivates continued cooperation.The situations where such cooperation in fact occurs in the animal world are highly constrained. The main constraint is that such cooperation is restricted to relationships where at least one of the participants is more or less forced to be in the proximity of the other. The most common case is when parasites, and hosts whose bodies they share, evolve into symbiotes. If the interests of the parasite and the host coincide, so that both working together would be more fit than either on their own, (i.e. the parasite is also providing some benefit to the host), then, if they can play a successful game of Tit-for-Tat, they will evolve into symbiosis -- a state where their interests, and especially the exit mechanism of genes from one generation to the next, coincides. They become as a single organism. However, there is much more than cooperation going on here -- there is also exploitation. They occur simultaneously. The situation is ananalogous to an institution humans would develop -- tribute -- which we will analyze below.Some very special instances occur that do not involve parasite and host sharing the same body and evolving into symbiotes. Rather, they involve non-kin animals and highly constrained territory. A prominent example Dawkins describes are cleaner fish. These fish swim in and out of the mouths of their hosts, eating the bacteria there, benefiting the host fish. The host fish could cheat -- it could wait for the cleaner to finish its job, then eat it. But they don't. Since they are both mobile, they are both potentially free to leave the relationship. However, the cleaner fish have evolved a very strong sense of individual territoriality, and have stripes and dances that are difficult to spoof -- much like a difficult to forge brand logo. So the host fish know where to go to get cleaned -- and they know that if they cheat, they will have to start over again with a new distrustful cleaner fish. The entrance costs, and thus the exit costs, of the relationship are high, so that it works out without cheating. Besides, the cleaner fish are tiny, so the benefit of eating them is not large compared to the benefit of a small number of, or even one, cleaning.One of the most pertinent examples.is the vampire bat. As their name suggests, they suck the blood of prey mammals. The interesting thing is that, on a good night, they bring back a surplus; on a bad night, nothing. Their dark business is highly unpredictable. As a result, the lucky (or skilled) bats often share blood with the less lucky (or skilled) bats in their cave. They vomit up the blood and the grateful recipient eats it.The vast majority of these recipients are kin. Out of 110 such regurgitations witnessed by the strong-stomached biologist G.S. Wilkinson, 77 were cases of mothers feeding their children, and most of the other cases also involved genetic kin. There were, however, a small number that could not be explained by kin altruism. To demonstrate these were cases of reciprocal altruism, Wilkinson combined the populations of bats from two different groups. Bats, with very rare exception, only fed old friends from their original group. [D89]. Such cooperation requires building a long-term relationship, where partners interact often, recognize each other, and keep track of each other's behavior. The bat cave helps constrain the bats into long-term relationships where such bonds can form.We will see that some humans, too, chose highly risky and discontinuous prey items, and shared the resulting surpluses with non-kin. Indeed, they accomplished this to a far greater extent than the vampire bat. How they did so is the main subject of our essay. Dawkins suggests, "money is a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism", but then pursues this fascinating idea no further. We will.Among small human groups, public reputation can supercede retaliation by a single individual to motivate cooperation in delayed reciprocation. However, reputational beliefs can suffer from two major kinds of errors -- errors of about which person did what, and errors in appraising the value or damages caused by that act.The need to remember faces and favors is a major cognitive hurdle, but one that most humans find relatively easy to overcome. Recognizing faces is easy, but remembering that a favor took place when such memory needs to be recalled can be harder. Remembering the specifics about a favor that gave it a certain value to the favored is harder still. Avoiding disputes and misunderstandings can be improbable or prohibitively difficult.The appraisal or value measurement problem is very broad. For humans it comes into play in any system of exchange -- reciprocation of favors, barter, money, credit, employment, or purchase in a market. It is important in extortion, taxation, tribute, and the setting of judicial penalties. It is even important in reciprocal altruism in animals. Consider monkeys exchanging favors -- say pieces of fruit for back scratches. Mutual grooming can remove ticks and fleas that an individual can't see or reach. But just how much grooming versus how many pieces of fruit constitutes a reciprocation that both sides will consider to be "fair", or in other words not a defection? Is twenty minutes of backscratching worth one piece of fruit or two? And how big a piece?Even the simple case of trading blood for blood is more complicated then it seems. Just how do the bats estimate the value of blood they have received? Do they estimate the value of a favor by weight, by bulk, by taste, by its ability to satiate hunger, or other variables? Just the same, measurement complications arise even in the simple monkey exchange of "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours".For the vast majority of potential exchanges, the measurement problem is intractible for animals. Even more than the easier problem of remembering faces and matching them to favors, the ability of both parties to agree with sufficient accuracy on an estimate of the value of a favor in the first place is probably the main barrier to reciprocal altruism among animals.Just the stone tool-kit of even early Paleolithic man that has survived for us to find was in some ways too complicated for brains of our size. Keeping track of favors involving them -- who manufactured what quality of tool for whom, and therefore who owed whom what, and so on -- would have been too difficult outside the boundaries of the clan. Add onto that, quite likely, a large variety of organic objects, ephemeral services (such as grooming), and so on that have not survived. After even a small fraction of these goods had been transferred and services performed our brains, as inflated as they are, could not possibly keep track of who owed what to whom. Today we often write these things down -- but Paleolithic man had no writing. If cooperation occured between clans and even tribes, as the archaeological record indicates in fact occured, the problem gets far worse still, since hunter-gatherer tribes were usually highly antagonistic and mutually distrustful.If clams can be money, furs can be money, gold can be money, and so on -- if money is not just coins or notes issued by a government under legal tender laws, but rather can be wide variety of objects -- then just what is money anyway? And why did humans, often living on the brink of starvation, spend so much time making and enjoying those necklaces when they could have been dong more hunting and gathering? Nineteenth century economist Carl Menger [M1892] first described how money evolves naturally and inevitably from a sufficient volume of commodity barter. In modern economic terms the story is similar to Menger's.Barter requires a coincidence of interests. Alice grows some pecans and wants some apples; Bob grows apples and want some pecans. They just happen to have their orchards near each other, and Alice just happens to trust Bob enough to wait between pecan harvest time and apple harvest time. Assuming all these conditions are met, barter works pretty well. But if Alice was growing oranges, even if Bob wanted oranges as well as pecans, they'd be out of luck -- oranges and apples don 't both grow well in the same climate. If Alice and Bob didn't trust each other, and couldn't find a third party to be a middleman [L94] or enforce a contract, they'd also be out of luck.Further complications could arise. Alice and Bob can't fully articulate a promise to sell pecans or apples in the future, because, among other possibilities, Alice could keep the best pecans to herself (and Bob the best apples), giving the other the dregs. Comparing the qualities as well as the quantities of two different kinds of goods is all the more difficult when the state of one of the goods is only a memory. Furthermore, neither can anticipate events such as a bad harvest. These complications greatly add to the problem of Alice and Bob deciding whether separated reciprocal altruism has truly been reciprocal. These kinds of complications increase the greater the time interval and uncertainty between the original transaction and the reciprocation.A related problem is that, as engineers would say, barter "doesn't scale". Barter works well at small volumes but becomes increasingly costly at large volumes, until it becomes too costly to be worth the effort. If there are n goods and services to be traded, a barter market requires n^2 prices. Five products would require twenty-five prices, which is not too bad, but 500 products would require 250,000 prices, which is far beyond what is practical for one person to keep track of. With money, there are only n prices -- 500 products, 500 prices. Money for this purpose can work either as a medium of exchange or simply as a standard of value -- as long as the number of money prices themselves do not grow too large to memorize or change too often. (The latter problem, along with an implicit insurance "contract", along with the lack of a competitive market may explain why prices were often set by long-evolved custom rather than proximate negotiation).Barter requires, in other words, coincidences of supply or skills, preferences, time, and low transaction costs. Its cost increases far faster than the growth in the number of goods traded. Barter certainly works much better than no trade at all, and has been widely practiced. But it is quite limited compared to trade with money.Primitive money existed long before large scale trade networks. Money had an even earlier and more important use. Money greatly improved the workings of even small barter networks by greatly reducing the need for credit. Simultaneous coincidence of preference was far rarer than coincidences across long spans of time. With money Alice could gather for Bob during the ripening of the blueberries this month, and Bob hunt for Alice during the migration of the mammoth herds six months later, without either having to keep track of who owed who, or trust the other's memory or honesty. A mother's much greater investment in child rearing could be secured by gifts of unforgeable valuables. Money converts the division of labor problem from a prisoner's dilemma into a simple swap.The proto-money used by many hunter-gatherer tribes looks very different from modern money, now serves a different role in our modern culture, and had a function probably limited to small trade networks and other local institutions discussed below. I will thus call such money collectibles instead of money proper. The terms used in the anthropological literature for such objects are usually either "money", defined more broadly than just government printed notes and coins but more narrowly than we will use "collectible" in this essay, or the vague "valuable", which sometimes refers to items that are not collectibles in the sense of this essay.Reasons for choosing the term collectible over other possible names for proto-money will become apparent. Collectibles had very specific attributes. They were not merely symbolic. While the concrete objects and attributes valued as collectible could vary between cultures, they were far from arbitrary. The primary and ultimate evolutionary function of collectibles was as a medium for storing and transfering wealth. Some kinds of collectibles, such as wampum, could be quite functional as money as we moderns know it, where the economic and social conditions encouraged trade. I will occasionally use the terms "proto-money" and "primitive money" interchangeably with "collectible" when discussing pre-coinage media of wealth transfer.More here.

To stay alive.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which usually has the final say on most U.S. patent appeals, and thus the most influence on the development of U.S. patent law, has recently been eroding conservation of rights, the principle that you cannot sell or claim more than you own, and in particular that you can't reclaim it once you sell it.  Under the patent exhaustion rule, which is as old as patent law itself, patent rights are exhausted upon the first sale of an object embodying the patent.  The patent holder is effectively allowed to sell the patent rights once per object, rather than maintaining control shared control over the object with the object's owners and possessors through its entire lifetime.   The patent holder is allowed to collect a royalty only once per object.  Once the first sale occurs, the object reverts from being held in a tangle of intellectual property, with a potential wide variety of "owners" imposing a wide variety of restrictions, to being owned outright by a single person or express partnership as traditional (i.e. real or personal) property.The Federal Circuit has eroded this principle in a number of ways: by ignoring foreign sales (so that for example an object first sold in Canada under a Canadian patent, then imported into the U.S., comes under the thrall of the equivalent U.S. patent), by excluding certain kinds of patents from the rule, and by changing the default rule for implied licenses (i.e. ruling that the default implication was that resale was not allowed, effectively extending patent rights beyond the first sale), etc.   In some cases patent rights seem to disappear, but then reappear later on in the lifetime of the object.  In other cases the patent holder maintains a continued shared control of the object over its entire lifetime, despite any changes of normal ownership and possession over the object.  The Supreme Court today in Quanta Computer v. LG Electronics reversed, 9-0, the erosion of the first sale rule via change of default rules and via the exception of certain kinds of patents.  LG Electronics had licensed its patents to Intel, and Intel sold chips it made using that technology to Quanta, and LG sued Quanta for infringement.  The Supreme Court held that all kinds of patents are covered by the first sale rule, and that  the default (implied) patent license terms assume no further rights of the patent holder over the object:The authorized sale of an article that substantiallyembodies a patent exhausts the patent holder’s rights andprevents the patent holder from invoking patent law tocontrol postsale use of the article. Here, LGE licensedIntel to practice any of its patents and to sell productspracticing those patents. Intel’s microprocessors andchipsets substantially embodied the LGE Patents becausethey had no reasonable noninfringing use and included allthe inventive aspects of the patented methods. Nothing inthe License Agreement limited Intel’s ability to sell itsproducts practicing the LGE Patents. Intel’s authorizedsale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope ofthe patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longerassert its patent rights against Quanta. Accordingly, thejudgment of the Court of Appeals [Federal Circuit] is reversed.LG Electronics thought it could restrict subsequent use of the chips, and indeed had a cause of action directly against subsequent users of the chips (e.g. Quanta), via its license agreement with Intel.   The Federal Circuit agreed with this pathological reasoning, but the Supreme Court shot them down:LGE points out that the License Agreement specifically disclaimed any license to third parties to practice the patents by combining licensed products with other components. But the question whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion.Imagine Alice could make a contract with her friend Bob which gave Alice the right to confiscate things that you or anybody else bought from Bob.  If property rights would be confiscated from third parties by contract on ad-hoc basis, there would be no effective property rights.  Contracts should never be able to impose duties on third parties.  Only property law (via deeds, licenses, etc.) can impose duties on subsequent owners or licensees, and these transactions should strictly adhere to conservation of rights and intellectual property exhaustion if they are not to interfere with others' property rights. For property deeds to impose duties on subsequent owners, they must either be clear from the object itself (e.g. a physical object is obviously personal property clearly belongs to somebody) or they must be clearly written and publicly recorded (e.g. liens on personal property, real property deeds that define property boundaries and restrict use of the property, etc.)  Furthermore, there should generally be one set of restrictions based on one owner per object, or simple and well-known variations on that (e.g. joint tenancy), not a wide variety of restrictions stemming from a wide variety of people who "own" the object in different ways, i.e. intellectual property owners. An intellectual property license, when as here is not clear, should be construed to follow the default rules of intellectual property law, especially those rules like patent exhaustion that preserve a standard sphere of traditional property rights not entangled in a web of intellectual property.My kudos go out to our highest court for defending traditional property rights against further erosion by the Federal Circuit's pathological interpretations of intellectual property law.Here is Dennis Crouch's take on the case.
Semayne's Case, an opinion of the English King's Bench in 1604, is a very important case expressing the long-standing "knock and announce" rule when law enforcement searches a residence. This rule was formally recognized to be an important part of the U.S. Fourth Amendment in Wilson v. Arkansas (U.S. 1995). I've posted the entire opinion online and linked to it below. Semayne's Case is where the popular phrase "a man's home is his castle" comes from, but there's a lot more to it than that.I was going to write a blog post about the interesting conflict that is going to arise between no-knock searches (which, despite Wilson, are increasingly being conducted by increasingly militant and culturally distant law enforcement) and the recent "stand your ground" statutes in at least ten U.S. states and at least one European jurisdiction. Several other American and European states are discussing such legislation. These statutes generally provide a full defense to murder if the victim is an illegal entrant into an occupied residence (or even in some states an occupied car), or in some states if the occupant reasonably believes that deadly force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony within the house, including common burglary.It turns out I don't need to say much, because Sir Edward Coke has already done it for me in Semayne's Case. The special expectation of safety within and right to defend a residence and its occupants -- what Coke called the "liberty ... of a house" -- justifies both a kill-the-burglar rule for residents and a knock-and-announce rule for law enforcement.So forget the exclusion of evidence in such a search (per Hudson v. Michigan) -- there is now in at least a few states a much stronger incentive for police to behave with respect for household safety and security. Police need to enter a house legally, including announcing themselves per Semayne's Case and Wilson v. Arkansas, or they are, I argue, legally and m.orally put in jeopardy of their lives in a "stand your ground" state.It's important to observe that Coke speaks of the "liberty ... of a house" and the of thhue of whether the house is "a liberty." In Coke's time "liberty" was a synonym for a franchise -- a privately held jurisdiction. Indeed, the kill-the-burglar rule is a weaker version of infangthief, the franchise right to hang a thief caught red-handed on one's own land. Infangthief and other liberties were special property rights that had to be granted by one's lord and ultimately by the king, or alternatively by prescription (i.e. long-standing use that creates ownership under property law). Per Coke, liberty of the house automatically attaches to any occupied residence as an inalienable prescriptive right. It provides more protection against execution of process in a private lawsuit than against execution of process for for a criminal case (here referred to as process for the King). In either case, the official must knock and announce. The highly evolved procedural law of franchises is central to Coke's opinion. Coke analogizes the liberty of a house to a weak form of liberty where the king's writs run but where private officials execute them, i.e. a liberty "with return of writs." Coke notes that, while the owner of such a liberty (or an official of it, called here a bailiff) normally has authority to use force against trespassers, this does not give the liberty owner authority to use force against legally executed process where the liberty owner himself is a defendant: "a liberty is always for the benefit of a stranger to the action" not for the defendant. Thus, when process is performed legally against a resident, it can be executed forcefully into and within a residence despite liberty of the house which otherwise allows the resident a full lethal defense against forceful intrusion. To allow the resident to distinguish the two cases is one of the main reasons for the knock-and-announce rule.Under some of the new "stand your ground" laws the modern equivalent of Coke's liberty of the house now attaches to your car as well, so that you can legally defend yourself against carjackers with deadly force.My thanks to Professor Renee Lettow Lerner for her insights on stand-your-ground statutes and legal history generally.Without further ado, Semayne's Case.
Here's the transcript of a more in-depth radio interview with Russell Tice.  I am happy to see that this former government employee is, unlike some other government employees, working hard to "preserve and protect the Constitution of the United States" instead of to create loopholes that effectively destroy it.  He talks about, among other things, how he discovered an FBI agent following him, how secrecy by classification and compartmentalization encourages criminal activities at the NSA, and how the FISA court is an oblivious rubber-stamp unless the NSA is asking to do something very blatantly illegal.  This strongly suggests that the NSA by avoiding the FISA court is hiding programs that are very illegal and very dangerous to our democracy.  Tice observes that, by combining the Justice Department's highly distorted view of surveillance law with its disgusting opinions on detainment and torture, "you could have potentially somebody getting the wrong phone call from a terrorist and having him [the receiver of the phone call] spirited away to some back-alley country to get the rubber hose treatment."  It is already well known that completely innocent people have been detained and tortured by the CIA, and  that American citizens have also been detained as "enemy combatants," with the so-called "Justice Department" arguing that all of these anti-democratic, anti-freedom, and anti-human activities are perfectly legal.  Tice has offered to testify to Congress on the NSA spy scandal, observing that "[t]he freedom of the American people cannot be protected when our constitutional liberties are ignored and our nation has decayed into a police state."  That police state has been advanced by but did not begin with the current Administration.  It has its main origin in the legal opinions of the Justice Department.  That Department has often urged substituting very poor procedures internal to the executive branch for the real checks and balances between branches, for example judicial search warrants, called for by the Constitution.  Tice's scenario has a frightening high "potential[]" of happening if the Justice Department does not stop writing self-serving legal briefs that mislead the President, the Congress, the Supreme Court, other government employees, and the American people.
The non-delegation doctrine is often believed by legal professionals to have been invented by the U.S. Supreme Court in some time in the late nineteenth century. Furthermore, the popular theory goes, the non-delegation doctrine was only enforced by the Court very briefly in a failed attempt to stop the New Deal which broadly delegated economic lawmaking authority to executive and "independent" agencies.In fact, the non-delegation doctrine was well understood by the Founders and extensively debated in early Congresses. Proponents of the non-delegation doctrine observed that Article I put "[a]ll legislative powers herein granted" in the hands of Congress, and thus none of it in the executive branch. Thus, they argued, all important rules should be made by the people's representatives rather than by poorly accountable executive branch employees. James Madison in particular was a proponent of a very strong (by modern standards) version of the non-delegation doctrine. Madison and his colleagues used the doctrine to argue that several Congressional proposals were unconstitutional and thereby defeat the measures in Congress. In the Post Office debate I have chronicled, Madison argued that Congress could not delegate to the United States Post Office the ability to define main post office locations and the broadly stated origins and destinations of the major post roads. He admitted, however, that at some level of detail Congress could constitutionally give discretion to the Post Office to define particular local routes. How far up, in the fractal structure of postal routes, the Post Office could constitutionally be delegated such discretion remained unclear. The outcome of this particular debate was that broad grants of power to generally define offices and routes were unconstitutional, but legislation defining the broad interstate and intrastate routes between major towns and cities, and leaving further detail to the Post Office, was fine.The non-delegation doctrine has remained a slippery doctrine ever since, and since the New Deal has fallen into disuse. We thus now have very broad enabling legislation such as that of the Environment Protection Agency, which grants the agency broad lawmaking authority over "pollutants," including the authority to make rules regarding "any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicle...[which] may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public welfare."Thus, argue the plaintiff states and environmental groups in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide levels, even though carbon dioxide is not particularly mentioned in the legislation: given the scientific evidence that carbon dioxide causes global warming, carbon dioxide is clearly a "pollutant" that "may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public welfare." They go on to argue that the EPA further has the legal duty under this legislation to regulate carbon dioxide levels. Even though the Bush Administration has decided that the EPA will not start regulating carbon dioxide emissions, these states and environmental groups are suing for a court order to force the EPA to regulate vehicle carbon dioxide emissions.President Bush's EPA disagrees. It argues (in part by invoking non-delegation doctrine precedents) that this broad language did not grant broad powers over emissions of a ubiquitous molecule that is a necessarily substantial part of life itself. If the harm of carbon dioxide emissions is admitted, literal interpretation of the EPA's enabling statute, would, if it weren't for the above limitation to motor vehicles (and presumably similar limitations to power plants and other industrial activities for similar phrases elsewhere in the stattute) give the EPA power to regulate not only power-plant and car emissions but everything from forest and camp fires to the very air we and our animal friends breathe out of our lungs. Our bodies after all "burn" food calories and the oxygen we breathe in, producing carbon dioxide that we breathe out.Without a non-delegation doctrine, (or alternatively without narrowly interpreting the broad language to exclude such a ubiquitous part of our bodies and the air), a vast amount of lawmaking power woould accrue to the EPA, upon recognition that carbon dioxide is causing somebody, or somebody's property, some harm, without any further initiative by the people or its representatives. Surely Congress did not intend to grant the EPA such broad powers, despite the broad language, the EPA argues (due to the industry-friendly Bush Administration, since it's opposing its own bureaucratic turf interests).   The EPA is thus essentially arguing that grants of power should be interpreted narrowly: a principle of least authority should be applied.   Madison would have added that even if this is what Congress had intended, Congress is not allowed to delegate such broad lawmaking powers to a non-elected body, just as it could not delegate the broad decisions on where to locate main post offices and major postal routes to the Post Office. Such a vast new area of lawmaking power must be initiated only by the people's representatives, not by unelected bureaucrats.It's not clear whether the Supreme Court, if it decides to hear the appeal in Massachusetts v. EPA, will pay much attention to Madison's non-delegation doctrine. The car industry's brief (intervening on the side of Bush's EPA) dwells on a related phenomenon: given the broad grants of power in modern federal statutes, the regulatory powers of agencies often overlap, and it is this concurrent and thus conflicting lawmaking jurisdiction, rather than grant of lawmaking powers generally, that is improper. Thus, the interventors argue that regulation of carbon dioxide is better classified as regulation of fuel efficiency than as regulation of a pollutant. Thus, it is under the jurisdiction of another regulatory agency, not under the EPA.Furthermore, the states and enviromental groups may lack standing for failing to demonstrate that global warming harms them in particular. As a scientific matter, much of the recent average global warming is highly likely to be related to rising carbon dioxide levels; a jury could find this as an unreviewable (i.e. not clearly in error) matter of fact. But contentions made about global warming as actually causing particular kinds of harm (such as the idea that it is causing more severe storms or bad crop yields in some areas) are highly speculative and probably cannot be reasonably proven in court. Thus, plaintiffs hoping to force the EPA to regulate will probably fail to demonstrate that carbon dioxide is causing them particular harm, and thus will probably fail to establish standing. Both the standing issue and the "no conflicting delegation" version of the non-delegation doctrine may thus prevent this case from reaching the traditional non-delegation doctrine issue. Nevertheless, the proposed massive expansion of the EPA into carbon dioxide regulation, without any Congressional act specifying that the EPA should regulate this ubiquitous molecule, but only harm-causing "pollutants" generally, is a very good example of the kind of thing that Madison was worried about and, for a time, successfully opposed.
Here's a bit of theoretical applied science I wrote back in 1993:Using materials native to space, instead of hauling everything from Earth, is crucial to future efforts at large-scale space industrialization and colonization. At that time we will be using technologies far in advance of today's, but even now we can see the technology developing for use here on earth.There are a myriad of materials we would like to process, including dirty organic-laden ice on comets and some asteroids, subsurface ice and the atmosphere of Mars, platinum-rich unoxidized nickel-iron metal regoliths on asteroids, etc.   There are an even wider array of materials we would like to make. The first and most important is propellant, but  eventually we want a wide array of manufacturing and construction inputs, including complex polymers like Kevlar and graphite epoxies for strong tethers.The advantages of native propellant can be seen in two recent mission proposals. In several Mars mission proposals[1], H2 from Earth or Martian water is chemically processed with CO2 from the Martian atmosphere, making CH4 and O2 propellants for operations on Mars and the return trip to Earth.   Even bringing H2 from Earth, this scheme can reduce the propellant mass to be launched from Earth by over 75%. Similarly, I have described a system that converts cometary or asteroidal ice into a cylindrical, zero-tank-mass thermal rocket.   This can be used to transport large interplanetary payloads, including the valuable organic and volatile ices themselves into high Earth and Martian orbits.Earthside chemical plants are usually far too heavy to launch on rockets into deep space. An important benchmarks for plants in space is the thruput mass/equipment mass, or mass thruput ratio (MTR). At first glance, it would seem that almost any system with MTR>1 would be worthwhile, but in real projects risk must be reduced through redundancy, time cost of money must be accounted for, equipment launched from earth must be affordable in the first place (typically A special consideration is the operation of chemical reactors in microgravity. So far all chemical reactors used in space -- mostly rocket engines, and various kinds of life support equipment in space stations -- have been designed for microgravity. However, Earthside chemical plants incorporate many processes that use gravity, and must be redesigned. Microgravity may be advantageous for some kinds of reactions; this is an active area of research. On moons or other plants, we are confronted with various fixed low levels of gravity that may be difficult to design for. With a spinning tethered satellite in free space, we can get the best of all worlds: microgravity, Earth gravity, or even hypergravity where desired. A bigger challenge is developing chemical reactors that are small enough to launch on rockets, have high enough thruput to be affordable, and are flexible enough to produce the wide variety of products needed for space industry. A long-range ideal strategy is K. Eric Drexler's nanotechnology [2]. In this scenario small "techno-ribosomes", designed and built molecule by molecule, would use organic material in space to reproduce themselves and produce useful product. An intermediate technology, under experimental research today, uses lithography techniques on the nanometer scale to produce designer catalysts and microreactors. Lithography, the technique which has made possible the rapid improvement in computers since 1970, has moved into the deep submicron scale in the laboratory, and will soon be moving there commercially. Lab research is also applying lithography to the chemical industry, where it might enable breakthroughs to rival those it produced in electronics. Tim May has described nanolithography that uses linear arrays of 1e4-1e5 AFM's that would scan a chip and fill in detail to 10 nm resolution or better. Elsewhere I have described a class of self-organizing molecules called _nanoresists_, which make possible the use of e-beams down to the 1 nm scale. Nanoresists range from ablatable films, to polymers, to biological structures. A wide variety of other nanolithography techniques are described in [4,5,6]. Small-scale lithography not only improves the feature density of existing devices, it also makes possible a wide variety of new devices that take advantage of quantum effects: glowing nanopore silicon, quantum dots ("designer atoms" with programmable electronic and optical properties), tunneling magnets, squeezed lasers, etc. Most important for our purposes, they make possible to mass production of tiny chemical reactors and designer catalysts. Lithography has been used to fabricate a series of catalytic towers on a chip [3]. The towers consist of alternating layers of SiO2 4.1 nm thick and Ni 2-10 nm thick. The deposition process achieves nearly one atom thickness control for both SiO2 and Ni. Previously it was thought that positioning in three dimensions was required for good catalysis, but this catalyst's nanoscale 1-d surface force reagants into the proper binding pattern. It achieved six times the reaction rate of traditional cluster catalysts on the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane, C2H6 + H2 --> 2CH4.  The thickness of the nickel and silicon dioxide layers can be varied to match the size of molecules to be reacted.Catalysts need to have structures precisely designed to trap certain kinds of molecules, let others flow through, and keep still others out, all without getting clogged or poisoned. Currently these catalysts are built by growing crystals of the right spacing in bulk. Sometimes catalysts come from biotech, for example the bacteria used to grow the corn syrup in soda pop. Within this millenium (only 7.1 years left!) we will start to see catalysts built by new techniques of nanolithography, including AFM machining, AFM arrays and nanoresists Catalysts are critical to the oil industry, the chemical industry and to pollution control -- the worldwide market is in the $100's of billions per year and growing rapidly.There is a also big market for micron-size chemical reactors.   We may one day see  the flexible chemical plant, with hundreds of nanoscale reactors on a chip, the channels between them reprogrammed via switchable valves, much as the circuits on a chip can be reprogrammed via transitors. Even a more modest, large version of such a plant could have a wide variety of uses.Their first use may be in artificial organs to produce various biological molecules. For example, they might replace or augment the functionality of the kidneys, pancreas, liver, thyroid gland, etc. They might produce psychoactive chemicals inside the blood-brain barrier, for example dopamine to reverse Parkinson's disease. Biological and mechanical chemical reactors might work together, the first produced via metaboic engineering[7], the second via nanolithography.After microreactors, metabolic engineering, and nanoscale catalysts have been developed for use on Earth, they will spin off for use in space. Microplants in space could manufacture propellant, a wide variety of industrial inputs and perform life support functions more efficiently. Over 95% of the mass we now launch into space could be replaced by these materials produced from comets, asteroids, Mars, etc. Even if Drexler's self-replicating assemblers are a long time in coming, nanolithographed tiny chemical reactors could open up the solar system.====================ref:[1] _Case for Mars_ conference proceedings, Zubrin et. al.papers on "Mars Direct"[2] K.

This is the first of a series of comments on the United States Constitution, with some riffs thrown in about U.S. history generally.We start on the eve of the American Revolution.   England had colonized a wide variety of places on the globe under three general models: proprietary, corporate, and royal.  All three occured on the East Coast of North America in the original thirteen colonies that became the United States.Royal colonies were technically part of the royal administrative hierarchy, but they were the least common type.  The most common type was the corporate.  Corporations ranged from Church organizations (like abbeys) to municipalities ("boroughs") to, most important for our purposes, the colonial corporations.  The East India Company, one of the first joint stock companies, is the most famous and powerful example of a colonial corporation, but most other English colonies and a number of the American colonies were also granted in this form.  Proprietary colonies were modelled after Counties Palatine: counties that were, except for a handful of narrow "extraordinary writs", immune from the jurisdiction of King and Parliament.  Unlike modern economic corporations, both corporate and proprietary colonies were granted political property rights.    These are rights to exercise coercive police powers: to collect taxes, to make and enforce certain kinds of laws.  Traditional political property rights, called franchises, were narrow grants to exercise very particular kinds of police powers.   The grants to colonial corporations were often much broader and vaguer, granting rights of "government" or "internal police" while reserving "the rights of Englishmen" to colonists.  Furthermore, the distance of their operation from the Crown and Parliament, and absentee colonial governors often lent colonists a free hand in governing, which they tended to do through legislatures elected by owners of real property.  Although under long English legal precedent corporate charters, and especially charterted political powers, are to be interpreted narrowly, the broad wording of many of the colonial charters made this hard to do.Some colonies (such as Virginia and the Carolinas) lost their corporate or proprietary status through quo warranto forfeiture proceedings and became royal colonies.  Others through quo warranto had their charters reissued in new forms.  In both cases, governors usually came to be appointed by the Crown and local legislatures gained broad powers of lawmaking on the subject of the "internal police."  But, as long as the charters were considered political property rights, no entity was sovereign -- neither the Crown, nor Parliament, nor the legislatures could exercise political power at will, but had to respect the political property rights; i.e. had to operate according to the colonial charter.The Romanist worldview is an ancient and pernicious one, and its reassertion in the 18th century in English politics led among many other things to the American Revolution.   The Romanist view dates back to the Roman Empire, and came to the modern world via the Code of the Empereror Justinian.   This Code was revived in the West by the new law schools (later universities) of the 12th century and became the standard law taught at Continental medieval universities.   England's universities, by contrast, did not teach the standard English law (common law) until the middle of the 18th century.  Instead, the standard English legal education occurred at the Inns of Court, and taught a legal and political structure radically different to Justinian's, one unintelligible to the typical university legal scholar or political philosopher.  Even though real law by that time differed widely from the Justinian Code, the Code has exerted an influence that slowly caused, first Continental, and then worldwide, political philosophy and then law to coverge on its model.   The Napoleonic Code and most other modern European codes are modelled after Justinian's.From the Justinian Code we get two totalitarian superstitions: first, that there must be a locus of power, a "sovereign", somewhere in any political system.  In Justinian's Empire, this locus was the emperor himself, whose word was law.  From this philosophy came the view of the sovereign king or dictator espoused by Bodin and Hobbes.  In this model the king is the "head" and the rest of the "body politic" is controlled by the king, just as our brains control our bodies.   Under Rosseau and Bentham, this locus was switched to "the people" or to, in practice, a parliament that supposedly represented "the people."   Under the extreme sovereigntist view, separation of powers, federalism, and political property rights are all an illusion -- all power is just a revocable delegation from a supreme locus of sovereignty.Actual English law and political structure were very different.   Under this law, royal power was actually divided among the King, the King's counselors, Parliament, and justices.  None of these entities was the "locus" of power but all played crucial roles.  Furthermore, much of this power had been granted to other entities -- nobles, lords proprietor, municipal and colonial and church corporations, guilds, and so on -- in the form of largely irrevocable political property rights.  Under the sovereigntist view, taught in universities, all such property grants were merely revocable delegations.  But under the actual common law, taught to the actual lawyers and judges of the time in the Inns of Court (institutions completely independent of universities, and thus largely uninfected by Roman Law), these delegations were property rights forfeitable back to the grantor -- and the original grantor was the Crown -- only under extreme breach of grant conditions under a quo warranto proceeding.The substantive law of Justinian's Code is quite valuable, containing a purely economic view of property championed by, among others, Adam Smith, and giving rise to our efficient modern capitalist economies.  But its procedural law is utterly totalitarian and helped give rise, first to the totalitarian Kings and Czars, then to Napoleon, and then to the communist and fascist dictators of the 20th century.  The English legal world largely avoided this fate, but the freedoms of its peoples have been undermined by its own creeping Romanism in the form of legislative sovereignty.   The political philosophies and "political science" of universities have always been dominated by the sovereigntist paradigm, which pits sovereign government versus "anarchy" as our only political alternatives.  When the Inns of Court gave way to universities in teaching English law, English legal philosophy and political structure too became increasingly Romanist.Of the legal claims made by the American Revolutionists, the strongest and most credible was their argument that the novel assertions of parliamentary sovereignty under Lord North violated the colonial charters.  But by that time American colonists, too, were under the spell of Rosseau's doctrine of legislative sovereignty.  Samuel Adams reported on the eve of the Revolution, trying to square the circle, that is to reconcile the supposed "supreme power" (sovereignty) of Parliament with the political property rights granted by the charters:[Governor Hutchinson arguing on behalf of Parliament] although ... there must be one supreme authority [Parliament] ... , this constitution [Massachusett's colonial charter] will admit of subordinate powers, with legislative and executive authority, greater or less, according to local and other circumstances." "This is very true," the council [per Samuel Adams] replied, "and implies that the legislative and executive authority granted to the subordinate powers, should extend and operate, as far as the grant allows; and that, if it does not exceed the limits prescribed to it, and no forfeiture be incurred, the supreme power has no rightful authority to take away or diminish it, or to substitute its own acts, in cases wherein the acts of the subordinate power can, according to its constitution, operate. To suppose the contrary, is to suppose, that it has no property in the privileges granted to it; for, if it holds them at the will of the supreme power, ... it can have no property in them.... But, as in fact, the two powers are not incompatible, and do subsist together, each restraining its acts to their constitutional objects, can we not from hence, see how the supreme power may supervise, regulate, and make general laws for the kingdom, without interfering with the privileges of the subordinate powers within it? [emphasis added]Since the sovereignty of Parliament was unacceptable to the colonists ("no taxation without representation"), and centuries of Romanist propaganda had by then extinguished almost all knowledge and recognition of political property rights beyond the Inns of Court, distribution of powers survived in the United States in only two forms: federalism (the nesting of larger and smaller territories, each with separate jurisdictions) and separation of powers (per Montisque, the separation between executive, judicial, and legislative powers).  "Sovereignty" still had to be located somewhere.   At first, during the Articles of Confederation period, colonies were dubbed "States" and declared by many to be sovereign.  But even under the Articles of Confederation this was a fiction -- the Congress, not the States, sent diplomats abroad, and the "States" had delegated military authority to a confederate army led General Washington.  As we shall see, the United States Constitution would render any talk of state sovereignty completely a matter of fiction, and it rivalled another fiction that would dominate in the long run -- that it was not any real entity, but a romantic fiction called "The People" that were sovereign.  Using this fiction, the nature of the United States Constitution as a fictional grant of political property rights can be elucidated.  Here is the preface to the Constitution, not legally binding, but illuminating of its nature:We the People  of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.The Constitution proceeds to list a number of legally binding Articles, just as in a corporate charter.  "We the People" was in fact a small cabal of delegates sent from state legislatures, who had only authority to amend the Articles of Confederation, not to unilaterally rewrite the rules under which said Articles could be amended such that they effectively scrapped them and started over.  But with concepts like "We the People" blazing across the mental sky, who needs legal propriety?Nevertheless, this nice fiction allowed the United States to avoid creating a real locus of sovereignty by creating a fictional sovereignty to satisfy the Romanists.  Sovereignty, under this doctrine, is vested in "We The People."  Some of this political power is granted, charter-like, to the United States federal government.  The rest is granted (per the 10th Amendment) "to the States, or to the people, respectively" -- that is to each State and to individuals.   In reality, political power is distributed amongst the federal government, states, counties, and munipalities, with a variety of enumerated and unenumerated rights that these governments may not infringe being retained by private persons.  Meanwhile, though, political property rights, which had been central to the colonial charters on which the United States Constitution was modelled, had been forgotten here, and indeed in England outside of the Inns of Court and the now-obscure passage on franchises in Blackstone's Commentaries.  The three main safeguards against totalitarianism in the United States would be federalism, separation of powers, and the Bill of Rights.
Climate-based explanations for the birth of agriculture are nonsense (like this one, via Marginal Revolution, which adds further nonsense about agriculture having originated around rivers). Their popularity stems from little more than the climate being an easily measured variable. There was plenty of good land quite suitable for agriculture in temperate climates (and, more importantly, in thousands of temperate microclimates) during the last Ice Age. There were many areas even during the coldest part of the Ice Age that satisfied the climate, soil, ecology, and other environmental requirements of early agriculture. They were just closer to the equator.More likely explanations for the agricultural revolution are probably far less observable:The crucial role of security for the history of farming may also shed light on the birth of agricultural in the first place. Hunter-gatherers were very knowledgeable about plants and animals, far more than the typical modern. It would not have taken a genius -- and there were many, as their brains were as large as ours -- to figure out that you can plant a seed into the ground and it will grow. There must have been, rather, some severe institutional constraints that prevented agriculture from arising in the first place. The basic problem is that somebody has to protect that seedling for several months from enemies, and then has to harvest it before the enemy (or simply a envious neighbor) does. Security and allocation of property rights between providers of security and providers of farm labor were the intractable problems that took vast amounts of trial and error as well as genius to solve in order for agriculture to take root.This would also explain how agriculture could spread from a single innovation yet look like independent inventions in the archaeological record. There were at least eight centers of secondary innovations (e.g. crop and livestock domestications and agricultural tools) that look independent: the Middle East, China, India, sub-Saharan Africa, Peru, central America, eastern North America, and New Guinea. But they all occured within a few thousand years of each other, after at least 100,000 years of anatomically modern humans. During these millenia humans were without agriculture despite large numbers of microclimates and microecologies suitable for agriculture during that entire period. This indicates the slow spread (with many failed attempts and, quite likely, many reversals) of a primary innovation necessary for the use of these secondary innovations. The primary innovation had to be primarily cultural rather than genetic because it came long after the out-migration from Africa c. 80K-40K BP and was taken up by many of the genetically diverse results of that out-migration. Given what we know about the importance of cooperation, institutions, and security to the productivity of human economies, that innovation which slowly spread and made agriculture possible was almost surely an innovation in the culture of cooperation. Alas, the spread of such an innovation in oral culture can be observed at best indirectly in the archaeological record.This would put the origins of agricultural into the more general large patterns of history, the most important of which are based on the interaction between security and wealth.
From The Playdough Protocols:Evolving beyond clay tokens, accounting was the first use of the external marks and started to take a familiar form. Along with the tamper evident clay, the Sumerians developed a kind of virtual tamper evidence. It took the form of two sets of numbers. On the front of the tablet, each group of commodities would be recorded separately -- For example on the front would be recorded 120 pots of wheat, 90 pots of barley, and 55 goats. On the reverse would simply be recorded "265" -- the same objects counted gain, probably in a different order, and without bothering to categorize them. The scribe, or an auditor, would then verify that the sum was correct. If not, an error or fraud had occured. Note the similarity to tamper evident seals -- if a seal is broken, this meant that error or fraud had occured. The breaker of the seals, or the scribe who recorded the wrong numbers, or the debtor who paid the wrong amounts of commodities would be called on the carpet to answer for his or her discrepancy.Checksums still form the basis of modern accounting. Indeed, the principle of double entry bookeeping is based on two sets of independently derived numbers that must add up to the same number. Below, we will see that modern computers, using cryptographic methods, can now compute unspoofable checksums.
The ever entertaining and informative Mencius Moldbug presents a useful but flawed account of the logical origins of money.   By "logical origins" he means the following:The basic problem with Menger's approach, from my perspective, is that he's concerned with the historical origin of money, whereas I am concerned with its logical origin. What Menger wanted to know is how money actually happened. What I want to know is how it can happen.Whatever his intentions, Menger's account today has much more value as a logical than a historical account of the origins of money.  Thanks to modern archaeology we now know that money (or at least goods that before the rise of coinage were valued primarily as intermediate goods, which I call "collectibles", the main example being bead jewelry) emerged long before the efficient markets that Menger assumes.   Humankind thus did not, with the exception of certain short and exceptional situations during the colonial era, ever pass through a stage of efficient barter markets that is Menger's setup.  Indeed so long ago (more than 100,000 years ago) did collectibles start being used that they probably played an important role in the evolution of human cooperation, as I describe here. But let's get back to the logic of whether and how money will emerge in a voluntary and efficient barter market.  Moldbug first gives a great description of why money is not like a normal commodity:...since buying and selling any good cannot fail to affect its price - ie, its exchange rate against other goods - we have a feedback loop. The herd selects an intermediate good based on its predicted exchange rate. But the exchange rate cannot be predicted without knowing the herd's selection. Problem!Moldbug describes his setup world of Nitropia, in which the storage and transport costs on which Menger based his analysis are eliminated:anyone can trade with anyone, anywhere, by teleporting goods. In addition, we'll assume that all goods can be stored perfectly without any overhead. Moldbug calls this an equilibrium where there is no money, just barter.  I don't agree -- given the mental transaction cost assumption (see below), money could emerge even here, in the complete absence of storage and transport costs.  I'll explain why below.Moldbug then breaks this barter equilibrium by introducing a good with a storage cost, fish, which rots if not soon eaten.   Sven the fisherman wants to fish, sell the fish, save the income, and when he's saved up enough buy a Cadillac.Moldbug claims that this eliminates the coincidence-of-wants problem from his scenario, but I don't buy it.  A coincidence of wants problem is just what we have here: customers want to eat the fish while it's still fresh but Sven does not want to purchase the Cadillac until he has saved up enough income for it (he apparently prefers delaying gratification to incurring the interest costs of credit).  Since the storage and transport costs of intermediate commodities are still zero, these provide no reason for Sven to choose one particular such commodity over another as a currency.  But because as Moldbug says, "[t]ranslating between standards is a pain in the butt," out of these intermediate commodities a single monetary standard will emerge.   In other words, Nitropia assumes transaction costs that create an incentive to converge on one currency.   Since Nitropia has costless storage and transport, this is just what I have called mental transaction costs -- the costs involved in making buying and selling decisions.  These include the costs of keeping books and otherwise tracking and comparing prices, and the costs of mentally mapping preferences to budgets via prices.But mental transaction costs are a problem even if there are no commodities like fish with storage costs.   A world of pure barter has O(N^2) prices for N commodities, and the mental transaction costs in such a world are correspondingly much higher than a world with a single currency and O(N) prices.   So even a market with no transport or storage costs for any commodity whatsoever, but with sufficiently high mental transaction costs, will converge on a single currency.   Not even the elimination of all storage and transport costs eliminates all coincidence of wants problems.  If Sven's customers want the fish Sven caught today because they are hungrier today than they expect to be ten years from now, they will prefer to buy it today even if Sven could costlessly store the fish to be sold with equal freshness ten years from now.   Even with zero storage and transport costs, time preferences for production and consumption create noncoincidences of wants, and these mismatches combined with mental transaction costs give rise to a currency standard.Menger's analysis does not and cannot show that the coincidence-of-wants effect is the only force that can result in standardized money. Perhaps there is another? Indeed there is.I disagree. What Moldbug's argument, properly corrected, shows is that some of the costs that arise from the noncoincidence of wants occur even if there are no transport or storage costs, but only mental transaction costs.  This contrasts with Menger's analysis, which defined the costs caused by the coincidence wants in terms of transport and storage costs.Suppose Sven is choosing between only two possible intermediate goods - Ia or Ib. Say Ia is palladium, and Ib is rhodium. What is Sven's algorithm?  It's actually quite simple. All Sven cares about is the change in the exchange rate between palladium and rhodium, across the time window T1 - T0 of the transaction. If (Ia/Ib)@T1 is greater than (Ia/Ib)@T0, he prefers palladium. If it is smaller, he prefers rhodium. In other words, he will prefer the I which will appreciate more across his monetary time window...[Now consider a population of Svens, each choosing an intermediate commodity].  Let's separate this herd into two strategies, by eye color. If Svens have blue eyes, they follow their proper MBA reflexes and diversify, buying equally priced lots of palladium and rhodium. But if they have brown eyes, they buy only rhodium.Who does better? The brown-eyed Svens. Why? Because [the introduction of a commodity that can't be costlessly stored [but as I observed above this is not really necessary; what we need to introduce are coincidences of wants and mental transaction costs -- NS]] has created new demand for both palladium and rhodium. There was no monetary demand before we broke the equilibrium - now there is. Ceteris paribus, the price must go up.Rhodium emerges as our standard, its price reflects its value as money on top of its value as an industrial commodity, and the price of palladium goes back to its mere value as an industrial commodity.   Given the vagaries of markets, our blue-eyed MBAs would have bought palladium too high (anticipating the possible increase in its value as money if it would have become a monetary standard) and sold too low (as glut and bust will follow this monetary bubble), while the brown-eyed colluders reap the full benefits of investing early in the money standard that actual emerged.But if we take this analysis further, our blue-eyed MBAs don't come off nearly as bad as Moldbug's scenario suggests.  If mental transaction costs, in addition to storage and transport costs, are sufficiently low there is no convergence on a single currency, because in a world of sufficiently unpredictable and volatile prices and risk aversion a party indeed benefits from stockpiling multiple currencies, just as they teach MBAs about investments.  In Moldbug's competition of blue eyes versus brown, the dice were loaded: the agreement between brown-eyed Svens to standardize on rhodium, and the lack of any attempt to set up a competing standard, allowed parties who knew about the agreement to predict ahead of time which standard would win.  If the outcome is significantly predictable, it pays to invest completely in the most likely winner.   But let's add a third group: green-eyed Svens that use just palladium as their intermediate commodity.   Green and brown eyes being of the same expected financial size (or of a completely unpredictable financial size), there is a 50% chance that palladium and green eyes will win, while brown eyes lose everything (except the original non-monetary value of the commodity, presumably negligible), and 50% chance of the reverse.   For the blue eyes, if they diversified evenly it's basically a wash.   The risk-neutral expected value of all three groups is the same, but if our players are risk-averse our blue-eyed MBAs have the strategy of highest expected value.   50/50 diversity is thus the optimal initial position when it cannot be predicted which of two commodities will gain value as money.   But since it's impossible to discover a perfect 50/50 diversification, and mental transaction costs are sufficiently high, the equilibrium is unstable and will coverge to a single currency.   Once one commodity starts to be favored, the optimal strategy is to move to that currency.   So we have shown that sufficiently high mental transaction costs are sufficient to cause the emergence of a currency standard, even in the absence of storage and transport costs.Reminder: we are neglectling coercive means such as legal tender laws and operating in a completely voluntary market.  But Moldbug's scenario also explains why larger governments usually end up controlling the currency, even in the absence of legal tender laws.   Markets will tend to standardize on whatever the dominant transactor, the party that controls the largest plurality of cash flow, standardizes on, and in most historical societies the dominant transactions were tax collection and the payment of those taxes to soldiers.  More recently government bonds and even more recently welfare payments have joined the fray, biasing the outcome still further.   By standardizing on its own currency, a large government can gain revenue from an "inflation tax."  This process is far easier for the government with a fiat currency than a currency based on natural unforgeable costliness (such as a precious metal).  Before the advent of modern currencies, inflation and the resulting revenue could only be obtained tediously via the slow substitution of less scarce for more scarce metals in the government coinage.  With paper the physical process is trivial, and only the matter of how the new money enters the economy is at issue.All the foregoing assumed sufficiently high mental transaction costs.   This has been the historical norm, because trying to shop or otherwise do business in a world of multiple currencies, much less of pure barter, has always led to confusion, error, and overly complex accounting, and would do so even given the costless teleportation of Nitropia.  But with sufficiently low mental transaction costs and sufficiently unpredictable exchange rates, it pays to hang on to multiple currencies, and a world of multiple currencies is the equilibrium.  At the extreme of zero mental transaction costs, zero storage costs, and zero transport costs, we have a pure barter market, with no need for money at all.Now for a more radical claim: in some cases, computers can drastically reduce the mental transaction costs of comparing prices in multiple currencies, which along with the "costless teleportation" of online markets allows multiple currencies or in some cases even barter to become the equilibrium.  I'm quite a bit more fuzzy on just what those circumstances are, or just what software with what user interfaces said computers must be running, but you can see some of my ideas here and here.  The general idea is that most of the mental costs of mapping of preferences to budgets via prices, in order to make buying or selling decisions, are offloaded onto a software agent, via a user interferface and a complier that translates high-level preferences to detailed "binary" contracts.
Hearing and reading many legal arguments has reinforced my belief that, as great as rational argument and readily observable phenomena are, we moderns have a superstition that they can solve every kind of problem.  They can't.  Rationality, absent the right kinds of express knowledge, may for some applications be very inferior to intuition based on tacit knowledge or rationality based on ancient wisdom rather than readily observed phenomena as its axioms.  Too often "rational argument" is just shallow and foolish rationalization and carries false authority because it seems rational.Furthermore, our ancestors' brains as far back some hundred thousand years were just as large as ours.  Why then are we so quick to believe that the thoughts in those brains were far more foolish than ours?Thus, I've long believed that there is hidden wisdom in ancient traditions that were long followed and that evolved through little more than trial and error rather than being purposefully designed and rationally explained.  On the surface to our minds these traditions may seem foolish, pointless, or superstitious, but there is often hidden wisdom to be found.  If found and expressed in modern rational terms, we may find something like that wisdom applies again, rather than our current beliefs, in future changed circumstances.  Here's a possible extreme example of some hidden wisdom in ancient tradition where we moderns see only rank superstition (although it may be a silly example, too -- the jury is still out).We now consider the ancient trial by ordeal to be a barbaric relic, and rightly so, but below I give some reasons to believe that ordeals worked to some extent, and that  they were among the best methods that legal systems could have used in Europe before around the 16th century when investigators started gaining substantial ability to gather and piece together circumstantial evidence.  The other widely used methods of fact finding before this period were direct eyewitnesses to the actual crime(rare), witnesses as to reputation, confession (often obtained by torture), and  grand juries of close neighbors.  Usually two or more of these methods were combined.  In England, it was common before the 13th century to combine a grand jury of neighbors (who usually had strong local knowledge of criminal and victim as well as often being witnesses to circumstantial evidence) with an ordeal.   Grand jurors had such profound personal knowledge of the defendant, a fellow villager, that they would not, as they are said to do today, indict the proverbial ham sandwich.   Rather, grand juries had usually lived with the defendant and victim for their entire lives, and thus had profound knowledge of the characters and circumstances that modern juries lack.  They might, however, be susceptible to bias against the defendant. The ordeal was added as an extra required step to let God, as they saw it, reverse the grand jury if the grand jury made an error or swore falsely.Some of the most common ordeals were those where the defendant was wounded in some way.  If the wound was healing well, the defendant was pardoned, and if healing poorly, guilt was confirmed.  For example, a hot iron would be used to burn the hand.  The hand would be bandaged up and then examined in three days.Two theories for how the ordeal could have been effective came across my mind earlier today (in a legal history class discussing ordeals).  I just searched to learn that these were previously and independently thought of by somebody posting under the nym "WolfKeeper".  The first theory is that it was an instance of the placebo effect.  With the placebo effect, often people will feel less pain, be more active (e.g. walk longer on a treadmill), be less depressed, etc. on treatment they think is real, but is not (e.g. a sugar pill) than with no treatment. Whether wounds will physiologically heal faster is more controversial.  However, it does seem to be thte case that more extreme treatments, such as surgery, have a greater placebo effect than convenient treatments, such as taking a small, easy to swallow pill.  Defendants probably almost always believed the religious claims about ordeals that they were truthful messages from God.  Under the placebo theory, if they so believed and were innocent, their wounds would heal faster; if they so believed and were guilty, they would heal slower.  The placebo effect would have been strong both because of the extremity of the ordeal and the strength of the religious belief.  The second theory may be a physiological cause of a strong placebo effect on healing, or may be independently effective, or both.  This theory is that cortisol levels would have been (and may still be) elevated higher and for longer periods for guilty defendants than for innocent defendants.  The most extreme effect of extended periods of high cortisol is Cushing's Syndrome which can cause rapid weight gain, easy bruising, and slow healing of wounds.  Weight gain and slow healing probably often occur to a lesser extent for less extreme elevations of cortisol.  Perhaps ordeal by water and ordeals by wounds, respectively, could distinguish higher levels of cortisol typical in the guilty from lower levels of cortisol typical of the innocent.  (I say "could" because much of the difference in stress, and thus levels of cortisol, could have been caused by the belief by both the guilty and the innocent that God would send a truthful signal via the ordeal.  Thus the effect might not be readily replicable with typical modern defendants).  The counter-argument is that an innocent person on trial might by as subject to long-term stress as a guilty person.  This argument will have to be resolved by experimentation, if such a study is possible with modern defendants.A third theory, which I at first dismissed in an instant and almost subconsciously as trivial, but which might in fact be very important, is that religious belief in the efficacy of ordeals might have convinced many guilty defendants to confess, whether or not the ordeal was otherwise effective.  This theory might be tested if we can estimate the frequency of confessions from the historical record.We might not be able to ethically test the placebo theory of ordeals.  But the cortisol theory probably can be tested, for example by testing, at the same early phase of prosecution (before trial is held or charges are dropped) the cortisol levels of people and seeing whether they are later convicted by juries or whether their charges are dropped early by the prosecution (assuming we believe today's prosecutors and juries are reasonably accurate!)The Catholic Church proscribed ordeals at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 and they soon fell out of favor in Europe.  This proscription is probably due to the effect of recovering the ancient rational thinking of Roman law and Aristotle in Italy over the course of the 12th century.  If the placebo effect theory is correct, the ordeal didn't merely become unpopular with the authorities -- it actually stopped working when people stopped believing that it worked. On the European continent, the trial by ordeal was replaced with, in many cases, confession obtained by torture.   It's not clear to me that a confession extracted by torture is any less barbaric or more effective than an ordeal.  Torture and confession did, however, comport more closely to the reborn Roman law.  In England, which lacked the strong hierarchical control by officialdom assumed by Roman procedural law, ordeals were replaced with trial by jury.  Grand juries became pro forma and the main action moved to the "petite jury" or trial jury.  Not until around the 16th to 18th centuries did Europeans learn to use circumstantial evidence effectively.  The methods the Continent developed for judges to formally weigh circumstantial evidence had quite a bit to do with the scientific revolution and the development of probability theory, but that is another story.  Circumstantial evidence and science are two areas where it did pay off handsomely to express knowledge and apply rational thinking to it. My thanks to Professor Renee Lerner and her wonderful legal history class for helping to inspire these thoughts.
The patent world was surprised today by the news that the Supreme Court will hear the case Laboratory Corp. of America v. Metabolite Laboratories.  The case involves the scientific discovery that levels of homocysteine in the blood can indicate a deficiency in two B vitamins.  But how the Supreme Court resolves the case may also have substantial implications for the patentability of business methods and even of software. We could get at least one strong opinion from at least one justice (John Paul Stevens) that from the point of view of today's patent practice would be very radical.  Such an opinion, described below, would imply the invalidation not only of the kind of scientific discovery claim in Metabolite, but also business method patents and almost all software patents.   It is unknown whether there are enough justices to make this a majority opinion.  The profound implications of such an opinion suggest that the Court may punt and decide the issue on other grounds.Section 101 of the U.S. patent statute (Title 35) states that patentable subject matter is limited to four broad categories: "process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter..."  This implies, presumably, that there other categories that cannot be patented.  For example, "algorithms" and "laws of nature" are two areas the Supreme Court has previously stated could not be patented. (Why algorithms are nevertheless now routinely patented is the subject of a paper I wrote last year -- I will attempt to summarize below).  The definition of what can and cannot be patented has changed over time.   The Supreme Court typically took a narrow view, for example in the Funk Brothers and Flook cases.  However, the most recent Supreme Court 101 subject matter cases, Chakrabarty and Diehr, took a broader view.  Diehr led to the modern view that software can be patented.  The Federal Circuit has tended to ignore the restrictive cases, allowing software to be patented and, in the 1998 State Street case, allowing business methods to be patented.Recently the United States Patent Office decided to align itself more closely with the Federal Circuit and loosen up its restrictions on patenting business methods.   But today, the United States Supreme Court surprised the patent world by saying that it will hear the appeal in Metabolite.  In this case, the "inventor" discovered a law of nature, namely that elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood tend to indicate a deficiency in the B vitamins cobalamine or folate.  To take advantage of this discovery, the "inventor" claimed (in claim #13): 13.  A method for detecting a deficiency of cobalamin or folate in warm-blooded animals comprising the steps of:        assaying a body fluid for an elevated level of total homocysteine; and        correlating an elevated level of total homocysteine in said body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin or folate. There is nothing novel about testing the blood for levels of homocysteine.  The only novel and non-obvious part of the claim is the scientific discovery, the "correlating" step.  If the claim is taken "as a whole," it (and any properly written claim covering any subject matter) passes muster under Section 101.  If, however, focus is put on the subset of the claim that contributes to its novelty and non-obviousness, that portion of the claim will fail as a forbideen "law of nature."  Here is how the Supreme Court in its opinion granting the appeal expressed the issue:Whether a method patent setting forth an indefinite, undescribed, and non-enabling step directing a party simply to “correlat[e]” test results can validly claim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship used in medical treatment such that any doctor necessarily infringes the patent merely by thinking about the relationship after looking at a test result.This will be the first time in over a decade that the Supreme Court has heard a case on this subject -- a decade that saw the end of restrictions on software patents (despite "algorithms" being unpatentable) and the rise of business method patents.So why can software be patented despite "algorithms" being a forbidden subject matter under Flook and Diehr?   Because clever drafters have added gratuitous steps or elements so that a patent claim, interpreted "as a whole," involves more than just an algorithm.  For example, if you discover a new algorithm, you can patent that algorithm running as a computer program on a "device with memory."   The "device with memory" is a gratuitous element, in that it does nothing to add to the novelty or the non-obviousness of the claim.   It is only there to turn unpatentable subject matter into patentable subject matter.There is an old methodology that would have prevented such clever drafting to get around the 101 subject matter restrictions.  It comes from the old British Nielson case.  This methodology essentially says that, for purposes of determining whether a claim covers patentable subject matter, you don't look at the "claim as a whole," (the Diehr test), but instead just look at that subset of the claim that is the inventive contribution.  In other words, look at only those elements or steps that contribute to the novelty or non-obviousness of a claim. The Nielson test was followed by the Supreme Court in expressly in cases from O'Reilly v. Morse (yes, that Morse, the telegraph case) in the 19th century to Flook in 1978.  Had Flook been followed, most software and business methods would be unpatentable in the U.S. today.The most rational, but also most radical, way for the Court to resolve Metabolite would be a return to the Neilson/Flook test.  Rational, because it's the only proven test we have for enforcing forbidden categories of patentable subject matter, whether they be "laws of nature," "algorithms," or business methods.   Radical, because it would invalidate at a stroke not only the Metabolite-style discovery-based claims and business method patents, but almost all U.S. software patents as well. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the Flook opinion in 1978 and is the only justice from that era still on the Court.   So there is a good chance that we will at least get a strong dissent along these lines.   However, the more likely majority outcome will, if it overturns the patent, do so on the more narrow grounds that it involves a mental step ("any doctor necessarily infringes the patent merely by thinking about the relationship after looking at a test result") or that it fails the 112 written description standard.
Mencius Moldbug repeats a currently popular quote from Thomas Jefferson:As Jefferson said (in 1820): "To consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men, and not more so. They have, with others, the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. Their maxim is 'boni judicis est ainpliare jurisdictionem,' and their power the more dangerous as they are in once for life."Jefferson was like almost all Whigs (the philosophy, not the parties) overly enamored of the legislative branch. (Bagehot's sovereignty of Parliament was the end point of this trend). Supreme Court tenure is the closest thing we have to political property rights and the resulting long time horizons in this country. It is also, at the risk of sounding parochial, a group of highly trained and experienced professionals. Would you rather have experienced software engineers writing -- or at least reviewing -- the code that runs on your computer, or bunch of frat boys who happen to speak smoothly and look good on TV?With the possible exception of the independent agencies, the federal judiciary is the only branch with anything resembling long term political preferences. This is reflected, for example, in the very high quality and care put into their opinions, compared to the typical ideological quackery and other ignorant nonsense that generally passes for political debate in the Congress and the mass media and beyond.The Court, it is true, has like the executive and legislative branches eventually succumbed to every long-term political trend. But it has severely attenuated many of the political fads most dangerous to liberty.The current popularity (and abuse) of this Jefferson quote stems from a propaganda movement Jefferson would have abhorred: to invest our executive branch with arbitrary powers to act unchecked by our Constitution.  The hot air in this whole debate about "who decides what is constitutional" also reflects the general ignorance about how separation of powers works. To summarize separation of powers in one sentence: it is a formal system of mutual veto. Under our corporate charter here in the U.S., our Constitution, Congress gets a full veto at will because it must originate legislation. The President gets a partial veto at will. The Supreme Court's veto by contrast can only be of a very specific and careful kind. It only gets to decide what it has to decide when asked to decide a case in the face of conflicting laws. It must decide whether a statute conflicts with our corporate charter, the Constitution. In such cases the charter must prevail. Articles of incorporation trump by-laws. And it must justify such a ruling in a legally professional opinion.Nothing at all stops the Congress or the President from vetoing legislation because they believe it to be unconstitutional, and indeed this was quite normal in the first century of our Republic to have long debates about the meaning of the Constitution in the halls of Congress. This was long a habit, up to the 20th century, until Progressive legislators decided they didn't much understand or care for that archaic charter. Even Congressional supporters of constitutionalism rhetorically shifted the Reform-and-Jingo media flack they got from arguing that a desired law violates our charter to the relatively immune Court. (This was recently reflected in Senator Spector voting for the Military Commissions Act despite expressing his belief that it was unconstitutional -- the Court will take care of that, he said).It is profoundly unfortunate that two branches have abdicated their responsibilities to our Charter, but the solution is hardly to strip the responsibility from the only remaining branch that still to some extent exercises it. What is most extremely dangerous to liberty for the executive to do is ignore such a Court opinion and proceed to execute a law that the Court has carefully explained violates our Constitution. This has happened to a disturbingly large degree in the current Bush Administration, for example with its warrantless NSA mass-surveillance pgoram. It most recently and famously occurred at a local level, where the Los Angeles County Sheriff released media celebrity Paris Hilton from jail in violation of her judicial sentence.   She had been punished by the judge according to law for her repeated breaking of drunk driving and probation laws.   This is one sheriff who should himself face some jailtime if we still live under "the rule of law, rather than of men," as the founders of our country intended.This kind of arbitrary executive power, but of a ubiquitous nature rather than as a temporary response to national emergency or the quirk of a celebrity-worshipping (or bribed?) sheriff, is what the current criticisms of the Court, if they prevail, will result in. This outcome would destroy one of the few remaining controls against arbitrary power we have left.
In our recent years of paranoia, which we slowly seem to be recovering from, one has often heard arguments that political policies or laws should be changed based on the failure of current policies or laws to address extreme cases. Here's a recent example:Suppose you knew for a fact that your family was in imminent danger of being murdered in a plot masterminded by bin Laden or some other homicidal psycho? Suppose, further, that you knew a confession from him would save the lives of your family. Would you be willing to have the authorities use torture to obtain it? or, if that doesn't make you sufficiently afraid,Picture this: There's a guy in police custody who knows the location of a bomb that's set to explode in an elementary school building that holds 500 children. Threats and intimidation have failed to make him reveal the address of the school and the location of the device. You suspect that torture would loosen his tongue and save all those innocent lives. What would you do?There are several flaws in this argument, one being that we rarely "know for a fact" events that have not happened yet, another being the dubious missing link in the logic here, that the information extracted would be reliable and thus help law enforcement prevent the danger rather than provide them with misinformation that distracts them from the real target.  But there is a more basic problem with these kinds of arguments when applied to any argument over what any law should be.The use of extreme examples preys upon the widespread ignorance in modern societies of how our legal systems work.  It assumes that our legal system executes laws as if it were a robot: law goes in, facts go in, defendant goes in, from the legal code and the facts the robot logically concludes that the defendant violated law, defendant goes to jail, period.  But that's not how our legal system works.  Rather it is set up to assume, properly, that no language can describe just outcomes in all cases.  It is set up so that when legal rules cause obvious injustices, those injustices can be avoided.   In the United States and Commonwealth countries, at least three different groups can exercise discretion to prevent obvious injustice to technical lawbreakers: prosecutors, grand juries, and trial juries.In the case of the torturer of an obvious terrorist who in fact saves many lives, it's highly likely that prosecutors would exercise their discretion to not prosecute.  They'd get overwhelming political support in doing so.   Even if they prosecuted, they would be unlikely to get a grand jury to indict.  And even if a grand jury indicted the life-saving torturer, it's extremely unlikely that a trial jury would convict.  Thus, despite violating the words of the law, our life-saving torturer would be hailed as a hero, get millions of dollars worth of book contracts, and face no serious risk of jail time.  Strong anti-torture laws, with no exceptions written in to the language of the law, would prevent the gross injustice and inhumanity of torture in the vast majority of cases where officials would be tempted to torture -- cases where the dangers posed by the torture victim or his pals are more pedestrian or less clear than the extreme scenarios put forth by proponents of legalizing torture.  In such cases the importance of not stooping to the barbarity of torture, and the extremely horrific possibility that torture might become standard law enforcement and military practice, should trump uncertain or everyday security considerations. Strong and absolutely worded anti-torture laws would not punish a torturer who clearly saved many lives in the extremely rare circumstances so often portrayed by these proponents.
It pulls hundreds of times the g's over far less time than what I had in mind, but I do seem to have helped inspire Lenape Fire Turtle and friends.  Their ice rocket is even reported to have stayed in one piece until it hit the pavement:Next Fire Turtle tried to make a pulse jet motor out of ice injected with propane. Alas, the exhaust came out a hole melted in the side instead of the hole intended.  If you look closely at the start of the side view portion of the video (the second half), you can already see the flaw in the casting where the ice is thin and the hole will appear:Having looked ahead to a future when the economics and technologies become propitious, my own proposal was to take a grinder to an ice cylinder floating in space, melt the resulting ice flakes into water, and feed that liquid into a solar thermal rocket engine.  The small snow-cone machine would gradually eat up most of the ice on the multi-year voyage from comet (or Ceres, or similar) to market.   Alternatively, ammonia might be extracted from the comet and stored as a liquid inside a tank made from water ice, adding complication to the extraction process but greatly increasing the efficiency of the rocket motor and thus the mass of water ice, ammonia, or other comet stuff brought to market.  More explanations of these icy and muddy daydreams lie here.  When I was a kid in body as well as at heart I just stomped around in mudpuddles.The ice rocket could in that future eliminate the need to launch from earth not just rocket propellant, but also propellant tanks -- or more precisely substitute a much lighter coat of sealing paint and sun shade for the tanks.  A well-shaded vacuum can become extremely cold, preventing the ice from sublimating away.  After propellant, tanks are by far the heaviest and bulkiest items that today must be launched out of our planet's deep gravity well, and ice rockets could substitute native materials for both.Meanwhile, it's all just good clean terrestrial fun.P.S.

Here's a rough citizen's arrest caught on film.  Plenty of action during the "more than 7-8 minutes" between when the photographer started shooting and the on-duty police arrived, despite a police station reportedly 2 blocks away.   Some interesting comments from locals (apparently most of them police officers) here.  Although freelance photographer Mike Anzaldi was there and I wasn't, I'm not completely without doubt  about his claim that all the blows administered by the Asian fellow (including a kick to the stomach not pictured here) were justified to "calm him down".  You can see some of the ambiguity between controlling a resisting arrestee and battery.  (For more of the story, hear Anzaldi's commentary and see more pictures at the first link above).  My kudos to Anzaldi for his great documentation of this event.  Not so much to the (presumably, since anonymous) cop bloggers with bad attitudes at the second link above, although they do raise one interesting issue, that the victim here did not end up pressing charges -- as a result, the alleged purse-snatcher was only charged with a misdemeanor.  Victims often lack an incentive to press charges, and police often try to motivate victims to press charges by withholding stolen property they have recovered.   If victims won't act out of a public spirit, or at least out of revenge, to help punish criminals, how can criminals be incapacitated and deterred?   By contrast the volunteer citizen arrestors here seem to be acting in a public or at least gallant spirit.  I'm not going to take it on faith, as the anonymous bloggers apparently do, that the police have great incentives here either, rather that this does seem to raise a public goods issue, to which police forces are a very imperfect, and in this case quite belated, solution.  (AFAIK, BTW, no charges have been filed against any of the arrestors in this case, and I doubt any will be -- they seem to be near but not over the line in using reasonable force to control a resisting arrestee, and even if they were a bit over the line police sympathize with their situation and would be loathe to arrest, and even if arrested and prosecuted a jury would probably let them off).Incidentally, if it had been police officers making the arrest here, those bites would probably constitute battery on a police officer.  But there seems to be no analogous protection for citizens making an arrest -- we should consider adding such protection where the arrest is legitimate.  (Often, BTW, the burden of proof on citizen arrest is much higher than for police -- in many states the arrestor must have actually seen the crime being committed, a greater burden than the typical police officer's burden of probable cause.  I am skeptical of this discrepancy, too).I previously posted on another case with a video showing a store owner shooting a robber, the first time in proper self-defense (or defense of others) under a castle law, but the second time apparently over the line between such proper force and murder.
From Advances in Distributed Security:A basic issue of security and fault tolerance that must be resolved is the secure determination of which order events occured in. If a contract specifies a deadline and it goes down to the wire, how can a relying party or third party adjudicator determine whether the deadline was met? The outcome itself, and its fairness, may rest on fairly deciding who came first. If Alice tries to double-spend a piece of digital cash [C82], only the recipient who checks with the bank first is entitled to its value. But if the bank servers are replicated, which of the two recipients Bob or Charles checked with the bank first? In the case of a replicated property title service [S98] we have a similar problem -- if Alice transfers her title to two other owners, which new owner actually received the deed? If property is homesteaded on a first-come first-serve basis, which of two or more "land rushers" competing for a lucrative parcel is entitled to the land? Lamport (Causal) Order Imagine a network where computers don't know how to keep time very well -- they are always getting out of synchronization. (Alas, all you have to really think of here is the actual Internet with PCs). Such a network, called an asynchronous network, lacks an accurate and secure global clock time by which computers can determine the order in which events, which might be messages sent or instructions executed on a particular local machine, have happened. Lamport [L78] was among the first to tackle the problem of how to determine the order of events in such a network.  A partial order means that we know in what order some of the elements are, but we aren't sure about some of the others, or some of the others may be equal. An example is the "less than or equal to" relationship among a group of integers, some of which can repeat. Some of the integers we know are less than some others, but an integer paired with itself is equal. A total order, on the other hand, is like the "less than" relationship among unique integers -- we can always tell when one integer is less than another -- there is no ambiguity left. In the case of events, a partial order means for some pairs of events we know whether one occured before another, and for some others we don't know. We use the same symbols as we would use for the analogous case of the integers, so that "x <= y" means "x either occured before y or we don't know whether it occured before or after y". In a total of events, we know for any two events which one happened first.   We write "x < y" meaning "x occured before y."  Lamport's answer to the event ordering problem was to show that parties (or, we use the terms equivalently here, nodes on the network) can agree on a partial order of events based on causal relationships between these events -- or at least the subset of events where we can determine that causation could occur. On a network, parties influence each other by talking to each other -- in other words, by sending each other messages. Lamport used these messages as the basic building block for constructing his partial order, according to the following rules:      1.  If an event is local to node P, every nonfaulty node agrees on P's opinion of it. 2.  Every correct node agrees that every message was sent before it was received. 3. If we agree that event A occured before event B and that event B occured before event C, then we agree that event A occured before event C. In other words, this partial order is transitive.     Breaking Ties -- Creating a Fair Total Order The partial order leaves us with the need to agree on how to break ties -- how to resolve the ambiguities where we can't agree which event took place first -- and thus create a total order of events. We want to do so in a way that is fair, in other words, in a way that cannot be manipulated to the advantage of any particular party.     An unfair way to create a total order would be to impose a certain predictable rule for breaking ties. For example, we could decide on a total order for the processes and break ties in the causal order by referring to this total order.   However, such a procedure creates a bias that may, depending on the application, favor certain servers over others, and therefore allow those servers to favor certain clients over others.   One way to break ties fairly is have the participants toss fair coins -- in other words, generate random numbers in a way that cannot be manipulated and then assign those random numbers to events. There are several ways to toss fair coins over a network and we describe one such way below.  Another way to break ties fairly is to have the participants agree to a global clock time that is more accurate than the message delays faced by those who would manipulate timing in favor of some party. This entails using a network with very predictable message lag for the clock synchronization protocol and a less predictable one for the other services.More here.

One of my main interests is the history of institutions, and in particular the patterns that recur in successful institutions.  These organizational structures and security mechanisms allow naturally suspicious strangers to interact with integrity.  These patterns include tamper evidence, shared time, unforgeable costliness, separation of duties, the principle of least authority, risk sharing, and learning from our ancestors, among many others.  These patterns have been useful for centuries, and (I can report after having spent many years working in the computer network security field) continue to be useful in the Internet era.
Navigation is the art or science of combining informationand reducing error to keep oneself on, or return oneselfto, a route that will get you where you want to go. Note what I did not sayhere. Navigation is not necessarily the art or science of locating whereyou are. While answeringthe latter question – i.e. locating oneself in a Euclidean space, or a spacereasonably projectable onto a Euclidean space – can usefully solve thenavigation problem, figuring out such a location often requires different, and oftenmore, information than you need to answer the questions of how to stay on orreturn to your desired route. And indeed this is what dead reckoning does – it getsyou where you want to go with different information than what you would need todraw or find yourself on a normal map. I hope to explain more about this important incompatibility between the pilots’ and cosmographers’ systems during most of the age of exploration in a future post, but for now I will give an overview of thehistorical development of dead reckoning.Between Italy of the late 13th century and the advent of GPS, dead reckoning formed the basis of most modern navigation. Dead reckoning was in particular the primary method of navigation used during the exploration explosion of the late 15th and early 16th centuries – the startlingly unprecedented voyages across unknown oceans of Dias, da Gama, Columbus, Magellan, and so on.Dead reckoning is based on a sequence of vectors. Each vector consists of two essential piecesof information: direction and distance. Distance is typically calculated from time and speed, so each vectortypically consists of the tuple {direction, time, speed}. With only speed andtime, we have only a scalar distance value – it could be in any direction. With time but not speed, or speed but nottime, we don’t have enough information to determine the distance covered.From the start of a voyage to the last docking at the homeport, dead reckoning was a strict regimen that never stopped: day and night, incalm and in storm, its measurement, recording, and diagramming protocols wererigorously followed.Measuring or estimating the speed of a ship was a craftmystery the nature of which is still debated today, so I’ll skip over that andfocus on the two more straightforward innovations in measurement, both of whichoccurred in or reached Italy and were first combined there in the 13thcentury: in measuring direction and in measuring time.For measuring time mariners used the sand glass, invented in Western Europe during thatsame century. I have discussed thisinvention here. A strict regimen of turning the glasses waskept non-stop throughout a voyage.For measuring direction, the ships of the explorationexplosion typically had at least two magneticcompasses, usually built into the ship to maintain a fixed orientation withthe ship. Typically one compass was usedby the helmsman, in charge of steering the ship, and the other by the pilot, incharge of ordering both the sail rigging and the general direction for thehelmsman to keep.The magnetic compass was probably first invented in China, usedfirst for feng shui and then for navigation by the early 12thcentury. Somehow, without any recorded intermediaries, it appears in the writingsof authors in the region of the English Channel in the late 12thcentury where it was quite likely being used for navigation in that often cloudy region. Its first use in Italy was associated with the then-thriving port cityof Amalfi. As both Amalfi and theEnglish Channel were at the time controlled by the Normans, this suggests to meeither a Norman innovation, or arrival via Norse trade connections to theOrient via Russia combined with now unknown Chinese trade routes. This is conjectural. Neither the Norse sagasnor writings about the Normans during earlier periods mention a magneticcompass, nor do Arab sources mention it until the late 13th centuryin the Mediterranean. In any case, it isthe Italians who made the magnetic compass part of a rigorous system of deadreckoning.Green dots indicate, in the case of northern Europe, the location of authors who mention use of the magnetic compass for navigation in the late 12th and 13th centuries, and for Italy, the traditional Italian association of the invention of the compass with Amalfi in the 13th century. Red indicates areas controlled by the Normans.A dead reckoning itinerary can be specified as a sequence oftuples { direction, speed, time }. Itcan be drawn as a diagram of vectors laid down head-to-tail. However, as mentioned above, this diagram byitself, for nontrivial sea and ocean voyages, contains insufficient informationto map the arrows accurately onto a Ptolemaic map (i.e. maps as we commonlyunderstand them, based on celestial latitudes and longitudes), yet sufficient at least in theory to guide a pilot following such directions to their destination.For recording speed and direction for each sand glass timeinterval (e.g. half hour), pilots used some variation of the traverse board, inwhich these values were specified by the locations of pegs in the board.Traverseboard. Pins on the upper (circular) portionindicate compass heading and (via distance from the center) for each half hour. Pins on the lower (rectangular) portionindicate estimated speed during each hour. The board thus allows an a pilot ona wet deck unsuitable for a paper log to record an equivalent of a sequence oftuples { direction, speed, time } over four hours, after which time thisinformation is transferred to the ship’s written log(normally kept indoors), the progress isplotted as a head-to-tail diagram on a chart (also kept indoors), and thetraverse board is reset. Note that the directionis read directly off the magnetic compass: thus north (the fleur-de-lis) is magnetic north, not geographic (celestial)north.In a future post I hope to discuss more about dead reckoningdirections and explain how the errors that can accumulate in such directions overlong distances were corrected. I willalso explain why neither the directions nor even the corrections could beaccurately drawn on a normal (Ptolemaic or celestial coordinate) map, and yetsuch dead reckoning directions are sufficient at least in theory for the pilotto guide his ship from the starting port to the intended destination port. In practice, pilots "fixed" errors in their dead reckoning using landmarks and sounding, which I will also describe. And I hope to describe how this resulted intwo incompatible systems of “navigation” (broadly speaking) during exploration explosion -- the pilot’s dead reckoning methods versus the cosmographers’ maps and globesbased on latitude and longitude. I also hope to someday figure out just why the explorationexplosion occurred when it did. Theadvent of rigorous dead reckoning -- combining the compass, the sand glass, and decent estimates of speed withrigorous log-keeping -- did not occur in Asia (where the Chinese, lacking thesand glass at least, made a less systematic use of the compass), nor with theArabs (who seldom used either sand glass or compass), which along with naval superiority explains why the explorationexplosion occurred from western Europe. Thepuzzle of why the explosion started specifically in the 1480s, and not sooneror later, however, remains a mystery to be solved.
There's been a lot of rhetoric about how human genes are only 2% (give or take a wide margin -- there are many ways to count it) different from chimpanzees. Despite all our fancy culture, biologically we're just another mammal, nothing special, according to this comforting and generous-sounding gem of relativism. Just, however, as in a computer some bits are more significant than others, some genetic differences are far more significant than others. So I've never been much convinced by the "small difference" argument to stop, despite the inevitable frowns at my supposed provincialism, believing that humans are, biologically as well as culturally, rather strange and wonderful as far as animals go.When you think about it, from several points of view, apes are already a bit strange for mammals, and we are a quite strange kind of ape. Our cerebral cortex is three times as big as a chimp's, but that is hardly the most qualitative difference between ourselves and other apes. We are bipedal -- quite a rarity in mammals. Unlike almost all mammals and any near relative we are naked. We have vocal chords and speak grammatical language full of metaphor. We have something close to monogamy, again rare for mammals, and many of us seem to instinctively collect decorative objects -- AFAIK a habit shared with no other mammals but only a few birds. Then of course there are hands and technology -- with which we've done unprecedented things like strip other mammals of their fur so as to don it ourselves and keep our own otherwise preposterously exposed bodies warm. The facial evidence has always suggested that some rather improbable and important things happened during our evolution that didn't happen with other mammals.Some genetic evidence for this human uniqueness has just been published. In particular, a very interesting RNA gene called HAR1F that operates during fetal development, and has been remarkably stable among almost all the other land vertebrates for the last 300 million years, has radically changed in the last 5 to 7 million years since our line split off from the chimps'.The difference between chickens and chimps - which are separated by 310 million years of evolution - is just two mutations out of a total DNA sequence of 118 "letters" of the genetic code. Yet the difference between chimps and humans - separated by 6 million years - is 18 mutations in the same DNA region.I don't expect this to be the last revelation of improbable and fundamental genetic changes that occurred between chimps and humans.I'm sure this will suggest to some intelligent intervention. There's already a big group of late night radio fans who think aliens intervened in human evolution, and it's also a good bet that religious "intelligent design" folks will use this finding as fodder. To me, it doesn't matter much how improbable we are, because we wouldn't be thinking about these things in the first place if it hadn't happened. In any case, the small number of chemical changes that these researchers have found in the HAR1F gene are not, just by counting them, improbable. Their improbability can only be deduced from the fact that anything similar occurred so rarely among other land vertebrates. But you can't deduce from that fact that it's so improbable that it's a puzzle why it occurred at all.The high improbability of our own evolution may actually make the alien-tinkering hypothesis less likely because it makes aliens less likely. If the evolution of intelligence is highly improbable this would substantially lower the factor f(i) in the Drake Equation, helping to explain the Fermi Paradox.Another point to consider is that evolution often doesn't follow neat statistical distributions. Rather it exhibits leptokurtism, wherein one improbable changes often makes other otherwise improbable changes more likely to occur. Once one improbable change occured, functional synergy and the exploration of uncharted evolutionary territory made the others more likely to follow. The leading candidates for the first improbable change that triggered the others are bipedalism, monogamy, and nakedness, not vocal chords or brain size increase, which are known from the fossils to have occured much later than at least bipedalism. Thus I conclude that the HAR1F changes, most likely implicated in brain development, were probably a late set of changes in human evolution made possible by some earlier improbable genetic changes.
Ron Paul scored a respectable, if hardly leading, 10% among Republicans in the Iowa caucus,and will probably garner an even higher share of the vote in New Hampshire.  (For my overseas readers, the United States is currently in the "primary elections" which determine the nominees of each party for the next President of the United States). Yet, at one extreme, traditional media has rarely mentioned Paul, considering him to be an unthinkably fringe candidate, while judging from the Internet buzz you'd think that Ron Paul was the leading Republican candidate. Google trends shows that "Ron Paul" (A, in light blue) has for the last few months been  searched for on the Internet more than any of the other major Republican candidates, and "Huckabee"(red) the second most:The large Internet presence of Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee is confirmed by the number of mentions as indicated by Yahoo search results:"Ron Paul"    52.5 million"Mike Huckabee"    32.4 million"Mitt Romney"    28.6 million"John McCain"    26.5 million"Rudy Giuliani" (+ "Rudolph")  22.5 million"Fred Thompson"           18.3 millionThis vast discrepancy between Paul's Internet presence and his traditional media presence has given rise to all sorts of conspiracy theories, for example that the mainstream media's polls are rigged against Paul, or that the Ron Paul effect is just a spam campaign being run by some eccentric millionaire. (In fact, while there may be a bias against cellphone-only young voters from doing landline polls, the 7.3% mean of polls was within the margin of error of Paul's actual 10%, and Google and Yahoo to protect their ad revenues go to great lengths to prevent spam from rigging search results). But there is something interesting, and far bigger than any particular candidate or ideology, going on.   CNN entrance polls from Iowa showed the following vote distribution among 17-29 yearolds: Huckabee 40%, Romney 22%, Paul 21%, McCain 7%, Giuliani 5%, Thompson 4%. Paul garnered more than twice the support of this demographic than he did among older age groups. I expect Paul to come in second among the under-29s in New Hampshire, behind Romney but ahead of Huckabee and McCain, but to rank below most of these candidates in older age groups. Here's a very oversimplified theory, but one worth thinking about: mainstream media is Baby Boomers and old people, and Internet is young people. By "is" I mean both the producers and the consumers of the media. And, as with the "generation gap" in the 1960s, they mostly don't talk to each other. (Along the same lines, the 1960s generation gap may have had much to do with television. But that's a story for another day). Furthermore, as with the monk's scribal culture versus the new print culture during the Renaissance and Reformation, and as with pre-1960s versus post-1960s culture, traditional media culture and Internet culture are very different cultures with very different views of the world. (Ironically, Ron Paul himself is an old codger like John McCain and Fred Thompson. He seems to be as surprised as anybody else about his support, which seems from the point of view of traditional media culture to have come out of nowhere).One could have used Internet search and result figures months ago to predict stronger showings by Huckabee and Paul than polls then showed, and especially to predict their relative strength among youth.  The Fox/talk radio axis ignore Paul and dump on Huckabee, not so much intentionally (they do have some reasons of self-interest to do so, but that's beyond the scope of this post) as  out of habitual cultural and generational differences and the simple fact that they and their audiences are not very aware of Internet culture and the fading of their mass media culture as being representative of conservatism.   Mass media, both left and right, have long assumed their overwhelming influence on elections from selecting politicians for coverage.  Although that influence remains very strong, the desertion of the young to the Internet is starting to erode that king-making power, and will erode it further in future elections.   Paul's message of extremely small federal government, in particular, is very threatening to federal government employees and the journalists who habitually socialize with those employees and depend on them for stories.  In the past this has been evidenced by the mainstream media coverage given to the Libertarian Party (to which Paul's message most closely hews) -- i.e. by the practically complete lack of any such coverage.  In the past Paul's message of adhering to the U.S. Constitution's enumeration of a handful of federal powers, which include neither welfare handouts nor wars undeclared by Congress, though entirely mainstream in terms of U.S. history, would have achieved no media coverage except being the butt of occasional jokes about "whackos".  Now not only have the "whacko" yuks greatly increased and gotten shrill (methinks they protest too much!), but some serious coverage of Paul has started to occur as well.   (Most of the latter, though, has been from left wing journalists who consider Paul's anti-war message to be mainstream). As for Huckabee, his southern Baptist evangelism, perceived by non-evangelists to be uncompromsising, is very alien and threatening to the owners, advertisers, and journalists in right-wing media, very few of whom are southern Baptists.  (There is much evidence of this religious war within the right wing -- another example was the right wing media attack on the Harriet Myers nomination to the Supreme Court -- but that thread is beyond the scope of this post).Admittedly, there are also other things going on with the Internet results, such as Paul's popularity among technology entrepreneurs and workers who, along with young people, are more likely to use the Internet for political discussion and to learn about the candidates. But the growing gap between Internet and mass media cultures, which is also in part a generation gap, should not be underestimated. Fueled by the Internet, I expect these gaps to grow more severe, and political ideologies and other cultural norms to trend more towards the developing Internet culture, in the coming years.
In the Rothbardian ideology of anarcho-capitalism, all law can supposedly be derived from contract, the entry into which is supposed to be voluntary.  "Social contract" theories of government also tend, by this euphemism, to suggest that the formation of governments was somehow voluntary, an idiotic idea that anarchists such as the legal scholar Lysander Spooner have easily debunked.  David Friedman justifies his neoclassical version of anarcho-capitalism by the Coase Theorem, which translated into legal terms is usually understood as the following: in the absence of transaction costs, and regardless of the prior allocation of legal rights, any tort ("externality" in economic terms) can be resolved by voluntary bargaining to form a contract, resulting in an economically efficient outcome.Here are some places where Friedman relies on the Coase Theorem:Consider two [legal protection] firms with somewhat different customer bases, bargaining over what court's legal system to agree on. Firm A prefers one legal system, say one that permits capital punishment for murder. Firm B prefers a different system, one that does not permit it.Each firm estimates the value to its customers, and from that the increase it can expect in its revenues, if it can provide them with its preferred legal system. We expect, along conventional Coaseian lines, that they will agree on the system that maximizes their combined benefit. [Source].A still more attractive and more likely solution [to avoid war] is advance contracting between the agencies. Under this scenario, any two agencies that faced a significant probability of such clashes would agree on an arbitration agency to settle them-a private court. Implicit or explicit in their agreement would be the legal rules under which such disputes were to be settled. Under these circumstances, both law enforcement and law are private goods produced on a private market...Readers familiar with the economic literature on efficiency may notice that my argument owes more to Coase than to Marshall. I have relied on the idea that parties will negotiate towards efficient contracts, rather than on the conventional analysis of a competitive industry....[Source]The proof that the Coase Theorem is false is actually quite simple: the assumptions of the Theorem contradict each other.  The assumption that transactions are voluntary contradicts the assumption that any prior allocation of rights is possible, including rights that allow one party to coerce another.   In  fact, for the Theorem to at all make sense, a very large and crucial set of prior rights allocations must be excluded -- namely any that allow any party to coerce another.But we can't generally solve externalities problems by bargaining under this revised assumption.  Externalities cannot be neatly distinguished from coercive acts, as extending one of Coase's own examples illustrates.  In this example we have a railroad with a train that, passing by a farmer's wheat field, gives off sparks, which may start a fire in the field.  In Coase's account, the prior allocation of rights might give the railroad the right to give off sparks, in which case the farmer must either plant his wheat far enough away from the railroad (wasting land) or buy the right to be free from sparks from the railroad.   The prior allocation might instead already give the farmer the right to be completely free from sparks, in which case the railroad can either buy the right to emit sparks from the farmer or install spark-suppressors.   If these are the two possible prior allocations of rights, Coase concluded that the railroad and the farmer will in the absence of transaction costs bargain to the most economically efficient outcome: if it costs less for the railroad to reduce the sparks than for the farmer to keep an unplanted firebreak, bargaining will achieve this outcome, and if the reverse, bargaining will achieve the reverse outcome, regardless of whether the farmer initially had the right to be free from sparks.  So far, so good -- it seems, on the surface, that if bargaining is costless an efficient outcome will be achieved.  The problem is that these are not the only prior allocations possible.  The Coase Theorem is supposed to work under any other allocation of prior rights. But it doesn't.  It fails for a  large and crucially important class of prior allocations: namely any that allow one party to coerce another.  Here's an allocation that may or may not allow coercion, depending on your definition of coercion: a prior allocation that gives the railroad the right to emit as many sparks as it wants.  In particular it includes the right of the railroad to emit sparks even if it could costlessly avoid emitting them.   Here's one that is fairly clearly coercive: the right to emit sparks even if emitting them costs the railroad something extra (i.e. giving the railroad the right to purposefully emit sparks to start fires even at some extra cost to the railroad).  Here's another farther down the coercive spectrum: a prior allocation that gives the railroad the right to torch the farmer's entire field with a flamethrower.   It is usually the case with coercion, as here, that it is far cheaper for the coercer to cause harm than for the victim to prevent it.   To increase the threatened harm to the farmer, and thus the revenue it can obtain from extortive bargaining with the farmer, the railroad can spend extra to purposefully threaten the farmer.  Here, it is likely far cheaper for the railroad to install a super spark emitter, or a flamethrower, than for the farmer to defend his fields from these sources.  Indeed, since any prior allocation is possible, why stop with the farmer's fields?  Another possible allocation would give the railroad a right to torch the farmer's barns, and his house, to kidnap his children -- any prior (ex ante) set of rules is supposed to be possible.   In turn, if the ex ante rules allow, the farmer could threaten to tear up the railroad tracks or sabotage them to derail the trains.  Under all these prior allocations of rights that allow coercion, the railroad need not just bargain to avoid the costs of supressing its externality (whether sparks or flamethrowers), nor need the farmer bargain just within this artificially voluntary spectrum of possibilities that Coase and his followers assume. Instead, if the ex ante rules so allow the railroad and farmer will bargain to avoid a negative-sum outcome: harm to the farmer with no direct benefit to the railroad, or vice versa.  Since there are substantial ex post benefits to one party from extorting payments from the other, the party that can threaten the most harm at the least cost to itself has, if the ex ante rules allow, a strong economic incentive to engage in such coercion.  These negative-sum games of coercion and extortion lead to highly inefficient outcomes, and they can only be avoided by carefully crafting the ex ante rules to avoid such coercion and extortion.  These coercive threats that make negative-sum games possible, and that decrease the payoffs of positive-sum games, cannot be neatly distinguished in practice from innocent externalities: any act or omission of one party that harms another, i.e. any externality, doubles as a threat, whether a tiny threat or a large threat, from which an extortion premium, its size depending on the size of the threat, can be extracted.In order to try to distinguish coercion, and the extortion it gives rise to, from an "innocent" externality that can be cured by efficient bargaining, there are ways to exclude some of these extreme possibilities from the prior allocation of rights.  And indeed criminal and tort law do this: they distinguish purposeful behavior from negligent, and negligent from the mere unfortunate accident.  But any such ex ante distiction contradicts the claim that the Coase Theorem applies to any prior allocation of rights.   Voluntary bargaining cannnot give rise to tort and criminal law.  Quite the opposite is true: at least a basic tort law is necessary to make voluntary bargaining possible.   Tort law (and the associated property law which defines boundaries for the tort of trespass) is logically prior to contract law: good contracts depend on good tort and property law.  Without a good tort law already in place, nobody, including the "protection firms" posited by anarcho-capitalism, can engage in the voluntary bargains that are necessary for efficient outcomes.   This is not to claim that the polar opposite of anarcho-capitalism must be true, i.e. that "the government" along the lines we are familiar with is necessary.  Instead, a system of political property rights that is unbundled and decentralized is possible, and may give rise to many of the benefits (e.g. peaceful competition between jurisdictions) promised by anarcho-capitalism.  But political property rights are not based on a Rothbardian assumption of voluntary agreement -- instead, in these systems the procedural law of political property rights, as well as much of substantive property rights and tort law, is prior to contract law, and their origin necessarily involves some degree of coercion.  Political and legal systems have not, do not, and cannot originate solely from voluntary contract.  Both traditional "social contract" justifications of the state and the Rothbardian idea that contracts can substitute for the state are false: in all cases coercion is involved, both at the origin and in the ongoing practice of legal procedure.  In both cases the term "contract" is used, implying voluntary agreement, when the term "treaty", a kind of agreement often forced by coercion, would far more accurately describe the reality. The real task for libertarians and other defenders of sound economics and law is not to try to devise law from purely voluntary origins, an impossible task, but to make sure the ex ante laws make voluntary bargaining possible and discourage coercion and extortion (by any party, including political property rights holders or governments) as much as possible.
Prions are alternatively folded proteins that catalyze the same alternative foldings in other (usually otherwise identical) proteins. Like DNA, prions can be replicators that undergo Darwinian selection:...although the prion “option” [analogous to a gene with two alleles] is clearly subject to conventional Darwinian evolution, in the case of [the prion's] natural selection [the prion] is acting on a non-mendelian, non-genetically encoded trait.Prions are a protein analog of disappearing polymorphs in crystals. With two "options" the prion as replicator only contains one bit of information, but that's enough to make a difference.One of the most interesting questions raised is when prions will act more like genes (and thus be largely beneficial to the organism) and when will they act more like harmful diseases. Prion diseases include Creutzfeld-Jacob and "mad cow" disease. According to the replicator/vehicle theory described by Richard Dawkins, if the prion passes through a similar reproductive route as a gene it will tend to be selected like a gene and thus evolve to behave more like a gene (in terms of whether its effect on the organism is helpful or harmful, not in terms of its mechanics, where a prion is very unlike a gene). But if the prion passes from one organism to another through some other route (as in the cannibalism route of mad cow disease and kuru) it will be selected more like a disease and thus behave more like a disease.
The need to sue can be an expensive burden. A plaintiff often needs to go through a very long and expensive legal process, the results of which may be little or nothing due to the insolvency of the party sued.Because of this problem, large chunks of commercial law and practice -- and especially the areas of mortgages involving real property, secured transactions involving goods, and negotiable instruments -- deal with allocating the burden of lawsuit. Generally, the burden of lawsuit over a transaction should be shifted to the partie(s) who are more likely to breach the legal obligations created by the transaction, or more likely to become insolvent, or both.Creditors often use collateral to shift the burden of lawsuit to debtors. Instead of having to sue to get their money, creditors simply repossess the collateral, shifting the burden of lawsuit to the debtor. Creditors sometimes also use a surety (e.g. a co-signer) to reduce the burden of lawsuit by adding a target who is more solvent.Another way creditors shift at most of the burden of lawsuit is by having the debtor sign a promissory note. The creditor can then sell the note to a third party who is entitled to collect the note as a holder in due course, free of most defenses to payment on the original contract. Freedom from most defenses (such as fraud, failure to perform, etc.) to the original transaction makes the debt owed by the debtor to the holder in due course very clear-cut, thus greatly lowering the burden of lawsuit for the new creditor. The original creditor benefited because it could sell this unburdened debt at a higher price than a debt burdened by legal problems with the original transaction. If the original creditor breached a contract with the debtor (for example by failing to deliver promised goods), the burden of lawsuit is now on the debtor to sue the original creditor: the debtor must pay the note regardless. (In the United States, there are some recent consumer protection exceptions to this general rule). If the debtor fails to pay the note, this is a very straightforward lawsuit compared to the usual breach of contract, and thus likely to be settled at little cost. Thus, the promissory note has shifted most of the burden of lawsuit from the creditor to the debtor.At a more basic level, the burden of lawsuit is shifted by shifting actual control as well as legal possession over objects of value. "Possession is 9/10 of the law." To this end, security technology and in particular smart contracts will likely become very useful devices for shifting the burden of lawsuit in commercial transactions.
One of the more interesting and well-documented events of recent human evolution is the rise of adult lactase persistence, which allows some of us to fully digest milk as adults.  All mammalian young, including human, can digest the sugar lactose found in their mother's milk.  Essential to this digestion is the enzyme lactase.   However, mammals typically lose this ability after being weaned, as a regulatory genes turns off expression of the lactase gene.   This loss of lactase production, and thus of lactose digestion, also occurs in most humans: most adults who consume milk don't digest most of the lactose due to insufficient lactase enzymes, and often develop digestive discomfort, a condition called lactose intolerance.   However, at least once in Africa, once in Europe, and possibly in Arabia arose alleles in the regulatory gene that kept the lactase in production in adulthood.  The spread of these new alleles probably occurred in cultures that already had domesticated milk-producing herds, the milk from which played a crucial role in their childrens' diets and indirectly in adult diets via fermentation (which, at some cost, convert some but not all of the lactose to molecules more readily digested by adults).The lactase regulation mutation that spread most dramatically was in Europe, until by now it occurs in nearly the entire population of northwest European countries.Modern frequency of lactase non-persistence as percent of the population in Europe.This European lactase persistence allele soon came to be most concentrated along the Baltic and North Seas, what I call the core area of lactase persistence.  Due to the heavy use of cattle in the core region, lactase persistence spread rapidly there, surpassing half the population by about 1500 BC.The European lactase persistent populations played a substantial role in world history.  The Baltic and North Sea coasts were the source of most of the cultures that conquered and divvied up the Western Roman Empire in the fourth through seventh centuries:  Angles and Saxons (founded England), Ostrogoths and Lombards (Italy), Visigoths (Spain), Vandals (conquered north Africa), Frisians (the Low Countries) and Franks (France) among others.   Later the lactase persistence core would produce the Vikings, who explored and conquered from Russia to North America and as far south as the Mediterranean, and the Normans, who invaded England, Sicly, and southern Italy led the Crusades among other exploits.   Still later mostly lactase persistent populations would found the worldwide Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch and British empires and originate the agricultural and industrial revolutions.  Estimated spread of the European lactase persistence allele in the core region in northern Europe over time.This was by no means the only gene evolving in the core.  Indeed, the same cattle-heavy agriculture of northern Europe, probably originating in and migrating from central Europe, also gave rise to a great diversity of genes encoding cow milk proteins. We found substantial geographic coincidence between high diversity in cattle milk genes, locations of the European Neolithic cattle farming sites (>5,000 years ago) and present-day lactose tolerance in Europeans.  This suggests a gene-culture  coevolution between cattle and humans. [ref](b) diversity of cow milk protein alleles, (c) frequency of human lactase persistence.Associated with the lactase persistence core was a unique system of agriculture I call quasi-pastoralism.   It can be distinguished from the normal agriculture that was standard to civilization in southern Europe, the Middle East, and South and East Asia, in having more land given up to pasture and arable fodder crops than to arable food crops.   Nearly all agriculture combined livestock with food crops, due to the crucial role of livestock in transporting otherwise rapidly depleted nutrients, especially nitrogen, from the hinterlands to the arable.   However, as arable produces far more calories, and about as much protein, per acre, civilizations typically maximized their populations by converting as much of their land as possible to arable and putting almost all the arable to food crops instead of fodder, leaving only enough livestock for plowing and the occasional meat meal for the elite.  Quasi-pastoral societies, on the other hand, devoted far more land to livestock and worked well where the adults could directly consume the milk. Quasi-pastoralism can be distinguished from normal, i.e. nomadic, pastoralism in being stationary and having a substantial amount of land given over to arable crops, both food (for the people) and fodder (for the livestock).    A precondition for quasi-pastoralism was the stationary bandit politics of civilization rather than the far more wasteful roving bandit politics of nomads. Compared to the normal arable agriculture of the ancient civilizations, quasi-pastoralism lowered the costs of transporting food -- both food on hoof and, in more advanced quasi-pastoral societies such as late medieval England, food being transported by the greater proportion of draft animals.   This increased the geographical extent of markets and thus the division of labor.   England and the Low Countries, among other core areas, gave rise to regions that specialized in cheese, butter, wool, and meat of various kinds (fresh milk itself remained hard to transport until refrigeration).  A greater population of draft animals also made grain and wood (for fuel and construction) cheaper to transport.  With secure property rights, investments in agricultural capital could meet or exceed those in a normal arable society.    The population of livestock had been mainly limited, especially in northern climates, by the poor pasture available in the winter and early spring.  While hay -- the growth of fodder crops in the summer for storage and use in winter and spring -- is reported in the Roman Empire, the first known use of a substantial fraction of arable land for hay occurred in the cattle-heavy core in northern Europe.  England's unprecedented escape from the Malthusian trap (click to enlarge).Hay, especially hay containing large proportions of nitrogen-rich vetch and clover, allowed livestock populations in the north to greatly increase.   The heavy use of livestock made for a greater substitution of animal for human labor on the farm as well as for transport and war, leading to more labor available for non-agricultural pursuits such as industry and war.  The great population of livestock in turn provided more transport of nitrogen and other otherwise rapidly depleted nutrients from hinterlands and creek-flooded meadows to arable than in normal arable societies, leading to greater productivity of the arable that could as much as offset the substantial proportion of arable devoted to fodder.     The result was that agricultural productivity by the 19th century was growing so rapidly that it outstripped even a rapidly growing population and Great Britain became the first country to escape from the Malthusian trap.There are thus, in summary, deep connections between the co-evolution of milk protein in cows and lactase persistence in humans, the flow of nitrogen and other crucial nutrients from their sources to the fields, quasi-pastoralism with its stationary banditry and secure property rights, and the eventual agricultural and industrial revolutions of Britain, which we have just begun to explore.
There are a number of modern mythologies that severely disturb our ability to think clearly about law and politics.   They encourage lawlessness by sowing confusion about the law.  You may have learned them from high school civics class, or from newspapers, or from your friends.   Indeed, almost all of us take them for granted, even though they are as fuzzy and false as the tooth fairy.   These statements and phrases are legally meaningless and politically muddle-headed, but people often utter them as if they were as obvious as the sun in the sky.(1) "...the government..." -- But there is no such thing as the government outside of a totalitarian government like Stalinist Russia.  (Actually, even Stalinist Russia was divided into Republics).  In the U.S. we have a federal government, state governments, counties, cities, transit districts, and so on.   Mall security can arrest shoplifters and in many states the resident of a house can legally shoot burglars.  None of these have arbitrary power, although people often think or act as if states or the federal government or the President himself do or should.   This phraseology is related to the totalitarian doctrine of internal sovereignty.   Besides federalism and separation of powers, another historical way to avoid this totalitarianism was jurisdiction as property.   A related myth I hear comes from my fellow American civilians whose commutes are too long.  They have drunk too deeply of the talk radio kool-aid and call President Bush "our Commander-in-Chief."  If you check the U.S. Constitution, you will see that President Bush is Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. armed forces only.   This phrase, with "the government", may reflect overuse of a biological instinct to think we live in one tribe and follow a single tribal alpha male.(2) "We have a social contract." -- But the principle behind much law of contract formation, such as the Statute of Frauds, is that any contracts involving momentous things, like real property, should be carefully considered and consented to by each person bound -- the rationale behind requiring that the important parts of real estate contracts be initialed and the entirety signed.    Politics is pretty important, so -- where did I sign?    Where did I initial my approval for the income tax, zoning laws, and our military adventures?   There is also the only slightly more plausible fiction of a claiming that jurisdiction is a voluntary relationship as a matter of constructive contract or restitution which I debunk here. Lysander Spooner also long ago debunked social contract theory.   Governments do indeed have the legal authority to tax, to make and enforce laws, and so on, but this authority is certainly not derived from any sort of contract with those they rule.   Furthermore, citizens generally have no legal rights whatsoever to be protected by any government from any sort of violence (except, sometimes, violence by that government itself), even though that has been said to be the main purpose of government.  To the extent government might be justified in common law terms, property and corporate law are much more realistic starting points.   (Note that the full form of this phrase usually involves the abominable combination of two mythologies: "We have a social contract with the government.")   (3) "It's the will of the people" -- But who are "the people"?   By what magical group mind and group mouth do they express their "will"?    This is another phrase that is legally meaningless and politically muddle-headed.   There are a number of related nonsense-phrases, e.g. "the consent of the governed", used as a justification for enforcing oppressive laws on the many persons who did not consent.So why follow the law, besides the obvious utilitarian considerations like not wanting to be punished?  We should follow the law for the same reasons our ribosomes follow our genetic code.  Both law and the genetic code are inherited information that we need first to survive, then to thrive.  They are both often highly evolved, with highly improbable functions that are often difficult or impossible to understand. Laws are blueprints providing the basic structure for social interactions, just as genes code for the interactions between cells and even some of the basic interactions between individuals.  To the extent political nonsense-phrases interfere with a clear understanding of the law and law enforcement, they destroy what many millenia of cultural evolution has built.(This post was proximately inspired by discussions I have been having with one Mencius Moldbug here, here, and here).
Our 2006 moot court competiton at The George Washington University featured Chief Justice John Roberts, law & economics guru Judge Guido Calabresi, and Judge Sonia Sotomayor (now a nominee to serve with Roberts on our highest court), and was replayed today on C-SPAN.  I saw this in person when I was at GWU -- it was fun to watch my fellow law students arguing with these seasoned judges about whether subliminal ads can be banned under the First Amendment.  H/T to GWU Professor Orin Kerr.
Hal Finney describes the surprising results of the Hotelling model of nonrenewable commodities: prices become much higher than the costs to produce the resource, the opposite situation from competitive markets in other kinds of commodities. Yet resource owners restrain production without the need for a cartel or any coordination.This occurs because, under the Hotelling assumptions that the commodity is not renewable and cannot be substituted for (and of secure property rights, as David Friedman correctly points out) the commodity producer can choose between producing today or keeping it in the ground to produce tommorrow, with no fear of permanently losing sales to some competitor. Any sales lost to a competitor today draws down the competitor's fixed stores and can be recouped at any time in the future.What the Hotelling model does not properly account for is that these very characteristics also make these goods great substitutes or hedges for money. Hotelling looks at a "fixed" or "prevailing" interest rate, but we should really be looking at expectations of future interest rates, taking into account expectations of future inflation. And we should account for changes in these expectations. If we do so, I think we will find the model to have high explanatory power (albeit not high predictive power, since we can't outguess the market about future monetary conditions -- but the search for predictive as opposed to explanatory power in economic models is largely futile anyway).Imagine a world with two currencies C1 and C2 and two nonrenewable minerals, M1 and M2. C1 money supply outstrips money demand by 10%/year, and for C2 by 5%/year (in other words, C1 "inflates" or "falls" by 10%/year and C2 by 5%/year). If the price has not properly increased to account for future expected inflation, people will prefer holding M1 and M2 to holding either of the currencies. They will play "hot potato" with the currencies: as soon as they obtain a currency in trade, they will try to purchase M1 or M2 with it. All holders of M1 or M2 will demand a stiff premium to exchange their minerals for falling currencies. What premium will they charge? In theory, the inflation premium is infinite: it is a "net present value" calculation of the depreciation of the currency into the infinite future. In practice, (as with the St. Petersburg paradox, and because no commodity is perfectly nonrenewable or perfectly immune to substitution over the long term), the premium will just be very high: not only far higher than the cost of production, but also far higher than the Hotelling model under the assumption of no inflation. Inflation expectations will dominate the prices of M1 and M2 in C1 and C2.Now imagine that inflation expectations change. If expectations of inflation in C2 to infinity go down from 5% to zero, we have in theory a change of net present value of revenue streams from M1 and M2 in currency C2 from infinity to zero, and in practice just a very high drop. It takes only a small change in inflation expectations to send the prices of M1 and M2 in C1 and C2 soaring or plummeting.Since the standard Hotelling model predicts no abrubt price changes, and the monetary model does, the monetary model is a better choice for explaining the actual dramatic price movements in relatively nonrenewable commodities such as oil that we have observed.Under imperfect information, since we have far better information about geology and technology than we do about future monetary conditions, and since uncertainty in monetary conditions produces far greater price changes than uncertainty about geology and technology, we can again conclude that abrupt changes such as we've seen are due almost entirely to changes in monetary expectations rather than in "fundamentals".Furthermore, when we see dramatic changes across a wide variety of commodities, being led by the less renewable commodities like oil, Occam's Razor (or equivalently, basic probability) tells us that there are not 100 different explanations for why 100 different commodities have all gone up dramatically. Rather, we need only two quite related explanations: changes in inflation and inflation expectations for the currencies they are priced in.Two commodities that come relatively close to being Hotelling nonrenwable commodities are gold and oil. For gold, the above-ground stockpiles are far greater than the annual production. For oil, the below-ground stockpiles are far greater than the annual production. The price of gold has always historically been dominated by its role as money, monetary substitute, or hedge, or equivalent, and the price of oil is also coming to be so in an age of floating currencies and in the current decade of rising inflation expectations.   When we realize that Hotelling nonrenewable goods make better long-term stores of value than less renewable commodities, we can explain why, while all commodities have dramatically risen over the last three years, the surge in oil has been disproportionately dramatic, and even more dramatic than the rise of gold: the rise in oil combines an increasing use of oil as an inflation hedge (mostly by the producers themselves curtailing production), which effects oil but not gold (which has long been used this way), with increasing inflation expectations (which effect both gold and oil, and other commodities to a lesser extent).It is often noted, in rebuttal to the theory that the falling dollar is mostly responsible for commodity price rises, that the dollar has fallen less gainst the euro, or against a basket of other currencies, than oil and many other commodities have risen in dollar terms. In other words, oil and most other commodities have also risen in euro terms, just less so. There are a number of problems with this argument as a way of dismissing monetary causes.The first problem is that these statistics only record falls relative to other currencies. It assumes there is some currency out there, or some basket of currencies, that is a stable standard of value that we can measure against. But there isn't. It's quite possible, and indeed currently quite probable, that the euro etc. supply has also inflated (relative to demand for the currency), so that all major currencies are falling relative to a hypothetical stable standard of value. They are just falling by on average less than the dollar is falling.  Just because there is no standard to measure them against doesn't mean they can't collectively fall (or equivalently, that they can't all collectively inflate, as defined by greater supply, less demand, or both for the currency).Also important is that the euro is too new and untested by time, and other currencies too small, for them to make good substitutes for the dollar. So when the dollar starts becoming dodgy, people turn to commodities to hedge debt denominated in unreliable currencies (which currently means practically all debt -- not just "junk" debt). So we have three monetary factors each causing commodity prices in dollars to rise:(1) More dollars chasing the same (in the short term relatively inelastic) supply of commodities. This directly effects only the dollar prices.(2) Greater demand for commodities as a substitute or hedge for currency-denominated debt, to hedge against further possible inflation.  Small changes in inflation expectations, as discussed above, can have large impacts on commodity prices. This increases commodity prices in all currencies.(3) A flight to safety from the credit crunch, creating more demand for safer forms of debt (e.g. U.S. Treasuries), and thus even more demand for commodities to hedge the currency risk from holding that debt. This increases commodity prices in all currencies.No "manipulation" or irrational "speculation" is required to explain commodity prices, and there may not even be a bubble (although a bubble could easily arise under such conditions of high uncertainty).   Rising commodity prices, and in particular the disproportionate surge in oil, are mostly or entirely just a rational and efficient response to the poor state of the world's floating currencies and the credit crunch. (This post is based on previous comments I have made at other blogs, including in response to Hal's post linked to above).
An agent (or representative) is a person authorized by his principal (or constituent) to act on behalf of that principal.   The task of the agent, ideally, is to implement the will, interests, or preferences of that principal.  The degree of communication and control of the principal over the agent varies greatly.   Examples of principal/agent relationships include employer/employee, shareholder/management, and voter/representative.   Agency law and principles can be applied, metaphorically or actually, to all such relationships.   Economists study the “agency problems” that occur when the agent’s behavior is influenced by other interests, especially his own.  A contract in which, when rules are not specified, one person is legally or morally expected to learn and implement the preferences of the other, or at least to maximize an abstract measure representing the preferences of another, is an agency contract.  Agency contrasts sharply with a grant of property rights.  The grantee, the person to whom property is granted, is bound by the rules of the grant, not by the will of the grantor.   A grantor can cause his interests to be represented only through specifying, before the grant is made, the conditional rules under which the grant is made.   Within the grant condition and boundary rules, the owner of property is legally expected to act solely in his own interests.  With political property rights, the “boundaries” are rules of legal procedure which the owner may not breach.   A similar but temporary effect can sometimes be achieved with a contract that details all of the rules of the relationship, with the legal and moral understanding that all else about the relationship is simply a matter of personal preference rather than of one party learning and implementing the preferences of the other.Representation distance estimates the degree of loss of information, control, or both in a principal/agent relationship.  In other words, it estimates the degree to which the agent fails to know or implement the true preferences of the principal(s).   In a representative democracy or republic, representation distance estimates the degree to which the representative actually represents the interests (basically equivalent to economic preferences, but in politics they might also include preferences to coerce others) of his constituents rather than others. Representation distance generally grows with the size of group represented.  Since even any two people communicate imperfectly, and have conflicts of interest between them, it's not even possible for one person to perfectly represent another, albeit such representation can far more accurately represent any interests than representing a group.  One can think of this distance as being minimal, call it 1, when a person is acting for himself. When one principal delegates duties to one carefully chosen and monitored agent (a.k.a. representative), the distance is some greater value, perhaps 2. Representation distance is further compromised by majority vote, which leads to two losses: (1) the interests become increasingly general and vague, rather than the specific and concrete interests the voters actually have, as the number of voters increase and (2) the interests of minorities tend to be neglected.   These numbers are purely illustrative (perhaps we should start at zero), and the function whereby representation distance increases with the size of the group represented is unknown.A similar effect occurs in shareholder/management relationships.  Shareholder interests vary greatly.   Their time preferences for dividends or capital gains vary greatly.  They sometimes have non-monetary interests, as in "socially conscious" investing.  But the duty of management to shareholders usually gets stripped down to a very simple one, a fiduciary duty to maximize profit.There may also be efficiency measures proportional to representation distance. For example, the efficiency of investment in public goods (where the "public" is just the population of voters) may be some function of the number of voters. On the other hand, larger representation distance may have a good effect in decreasing the ability of some voters to coerce or oppress other voters via the representative.  Vast amounts of money are put into  K Street lobbying, primarily by corporations and government employee labor unions.  This is readily explained by representation distance: the relationships between lobbyists and Congressmen, and even more between lobbyists and unelected but influential bureaucrats, often have a much shorter representation distance than those between voter and Representative.  (The much shorter physical distance, which greatly facilitates face-to-face relationships, greatly helps to shorten the representation distance, but these are otherwise independent ideas).  We can thus expect persons with sufficient resources at stake, such as corporations and government employee unions, to put far more effort into lobbying than they or others do into mere voting.Since a political representative represents not the only normal economic preferences of voters, but also preferences to coerce others, large representation distance is not necessarily a bad thing.  An effectively infinite representation distance is effective independence, which is often a good thing.   (We can’t achieve perfectly infinite representation distance, of course).  We want the legislative, executive, and judicial branches to operate independently, for example, not for one to represent the other.   However political property rights, or contracts where when the rules are unspecified on party is not expected to learn or implement the preferences of the other, are usually a far better way than pseudo-representation to achieve independence or infinite representation distance. Political property rights turn at least putatively will-based (a representative is supposed to represent the will of his principal(s)) system into a rule-based system (the owner must operate within the procedural bounds of his property right, and is expected within those rules to learn and follow only his own preferences).  Pseudo-representation -- the use of the language of agency depsite a very large representation distance -- may, however, provide an illusion of participation sufficient to satisfy the naive that their interests are actually being represented.To summarize, no group is truly homogenous, so it's not possible to perfectly represent any group. Since even any two people communicate imperfectly, and have conflicts of interest between them, it's not even possible for one person to perfectly represent another, albeit such representation can far more accurately represent any interests than representing a group. Thus representation distance grows with the size of group represented.   Much politics can be explained by problems caused by representation distances that are too long or too short, or by poor estimates of representation distance made by naive participants.[These comments are based on my comments on a previous post, and thanks to "anonymous" for reminding me about my old idea of representation distance, and for the idea that bribery of a representative by a third party increases representation distance from the principal].Here are some links to learn about agency law, the principal/agent problem, and political property rights.
Collision between a comet and a 370 kilogram projectile exposes subsurface ice, causing large amounts of dust and over 250,000 tons of water vapor to stream off the comet.   As a liquid that much water would fill over a hundred Olymic-sized swimming pools. NASA for now is sticking to Werner von Braun's World War Two vintage idea of lunar and Martian bases that import everything from earth -- including even such basics as propellants, tankage, food, air, and water. While these white elephants are still seen by most of NASA as the "next logical steps", there are a wide variety of other and often much better ideas for space development out there. I've long considered the possibility that comet mining, or similar drilling for any ice that might exist underneath the regolith of some asteroids (as we know it does on Mars), is a much more productive way to go.The argument for microgravity ice mining, laid out in the above-linked article, involves several steps of reasoning, but the most important parts of the idea are (1) that use of native materials, rather than hauling materials from earth, is crucial to productive and affordable long-term space development, and (2) that given the expensive bottleneck of launching from earth, the most important variable for space industry is the mass throughput ratio (MTR): the ratio of the mass of material processed per unit of time to mass of the (earth-origin) machinery required. Higher MTR translates to greater amplification of a small mass launched from earth into a large amount of materials processed in space. Cometary or similar ice can be processed to create propellant, tankage, and other useful items as described in the above-linked article. Snow maker. To develop space economically, instead of merely wasting large amounts of money on historical dead ends, we need to use native materials, and we need to process them with very high mass throughput ratios. Developing bases on the moon, Mars, or elsewhere in deep space without using native materials would be as foolish as if the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock had imported all their water, food, and wood from England.I endorse the ice mining approach because, even though cometary (and possibly asteroidal) ice is not conveniently located, we can generally process water with very high mass throughput ratios. Here are some approximate (back-of-envelope) estimates I've made, usually based on the linked descriptions of the process. I typically assume the machines can operate on average 20 hours per day, 300 days per year: Centrifuge that separates sludge from water at a rate of 200 gallons per minute. Snow cone machine (grinding ice into small bits): 67,000/yr. (In other words, the machine can convert 67,000 times its own weight in ice to "snow" in a year).Sludge separation with centrifuge: 3,000/yr.Snow making from liquid water: 330,000/yr.The MTR of a sequence of processes can be readily estimated. For example to grind ice into snow, then melt it (which I assume here has an MTR of 10,000/yr.), then separate out the dirt and organics with a centrifuge, then make snow with the now clear water -- a sequence similar to the comet mining process described in the above-linked article -- I estimate the MTR to be about 1,500 per year with the current off-the-shelf equipment.If this can be achieved for comet mining, then we can (for example) launch 10 tons of equipment and, by staying at the comet or asteroid for two years, make 30,000 tons of ice for various uses, including propellant, tankage, and radiation shielding. This is before discounting mass we lose from transporting the equipment to the comet or asteroid and ice back to a useful orbit, which will often be a factor of 10 to 20 -- see the above-linked article. Thus 10 tons launched into low earth orbit would result in 1,500 to 3,000 tons of water ice in a useful orbit such as earth geosynchronous orbit, Earth-Sun L1 (for the global warming application, link below), Mars orbit, or a wide variety of other inner solar system orbits. Old ice breaker. With a decent R&D budget we can probably actually do much better than the current off-the-shelf equipment, some aspects of which have to be redesigned for the space environment anyway (e.g. where the water flow depends on gravity). The MTRs of many of these machines can probably be improved by large factors by appropriate substitution of materials with better engineering properties (especially strength) per mass -- for example Kevlar, Vectran, Spectra, carbon fiber, or carbon nanotube for structural steel and diamond grit for grinding surfaces. Such substitutions would be too expensive for typical earthside applications, but make sense where transportation costs are very high, as with launch costs. This substitution is helped by fact that, unlike most other proposed processes for extracting propellant from materials native to space (e.g. liquid oxygen from lunar soil) these processes don't require high temperatures. Old ice saw. On a related note, here's an interesting set of pages on the ancient art of harvesting, handling and storing ice for refrigeration.Lest this all be dismissed as mere NASA-style entertainment, there are possibly quite important applications, including combatting global warming, for which native material based space industry is crucial. (No, the idea is not to throw big ice cubes into the earth's oceans. :-) Furthermore, once the first mission returns ice, it can be used as propellant and tankage to bootstrap even more ice mining equipment. Only a few such boostrapping cycles are needed before orbital ice becomes as cheap as water on earth. Since comet ice can include methane and ammonia as well as water, it can provide the raw materials for most of chemicals and bulk materials we need in space industry.   Indeed, all the above-mentioned advanced materials can be manufactured starting with these building blocks -- keeping in mind that the current earthside manufacturing processes will have to themselves be examined for MTR, reliability, and automability, and so the substitution of more simply produced materials may be in order, just as we are substituting a simpler rocket for advanced earth-launched upper stages in order to take advantage of native ice derived propellant and tanks.Of course, there many challenges with automation and reliability to be met. Some of these are being addressed by the current developments in deep sea oil and mineral extraction, which I am currently researching and will hopefully cover in a near future post. Here is recent evidence of not just ice, but (at least temporarily) liquid water underneath the Martian surface that has flowed out onto the surface and frozen. Mars itself, in a deep gravity well, is not an ideal source of water for use beyond Mars, but ice there suggests that ice might also survive near the surfaces of some asteroids that lie even farther from the sun. 
In his novel Cat’s Cradle, science fiction writer Kurt Vonnegut postulated “Ice-9.” Ice-9 was a form of water that was frozen at room temperature and catalyzed any normal water it came in contact with into more crystals of Ice-9. Once released into the environment, it froze all water, including us. Eric Drexler in the 1980s raised the specter of nano-robots that made copies of themselves and ate everything in their path: "gray goo." A wide variety of similar hypothetical disasters have since been given referred to as some sort of "goo."Self-replicating chemicals are not merely hypothetical: since Cat's Cradle, scientists have discovered some real-world example of crystals that seed the environment, converting other forms (polymorphs) of the crystal into their own. The population of the original polymorph diminishes as it is converted into the new form: it is a “disappearing polymorph.” In 1996 Abbott Labs began manufacturing the new anti-AIDS drug ritonavir. In 1998 a more stable polymorph appeared in the American manufacturing plant. It converted the old form of the drug into a new polymorph, Form 2, that did not fight AIDS nearly as well. Abbott’s plant was contaminated, and it could no longer manufacture effective rintonavir. Abbott continued to successfully manufacture the drug in its Italian plant. Then American scientists visited, and that plant too was contaminated was contaminated and could henceforth only produce the ineffective Form 2. Apparently the scientists had carried some Form 2 crystals into the plant on their clothing.Another instance of the “disappearing polymorph” may be the anti-depressant, Paxil (U.S. brand name for the chemical  paroxetine hydrochloride).  No, self-replicating Paxil doesn’t naturally spread into our brains and make people happy for free. It's not "happy goo." On the contrary, self-replicating Paxil converted, according to one of the parties in the ensuing lawsuit, an old, and now off-patent, form of Paxil into a new, patented form of Paxil. Once the new form, the hemihydrate form of Paxil, was created, its crystals started floating about, converting small fractions of the old form, anhydrous Paxil, into hemihydrate. Both forms of the drug work equally well as an anti-depressant, but it became impossible to manufacture the off-patent anhydrate without some of it being converted into the patented form. Call it "patent goo."Apotex, a generic drug manufacturer, was all set up to manufacture the off-patent anhydrous generic Paxil when it discovered small fractions of it were being converted into the hemihydrate. They couldn’t remove the contamination. Smithkline, owner of the patent on the hemihydrate, sued them for patent infringement. Apotex argued that the hemihydrate form occurred naturally, so that Smithkline’s patent was invalid. Smithkline argued that it was a disappearing polymorph, that the hemihydrate form had not existed before they had created it in their labs, and that it was up to Apotex to remove the hemihydrate from its product or pay it a royalty. Apotex was unable to remove the hemihydrate and unwilling to pay a royalty. Judge Richard Posner heard this case in the trial court and wrote an opinion that contains a good explanation of the self-replicating Paxil controversy. The Federal Circuit heard the appeal and decided that Smithkline’s patent on the hemihydrate was invalid as “inherently anticipated” because anhydrate naturally converts into hemihydrate. Normally, anticipation would require an actual reference describing the claimed chemical structure (in patent lingo that the hemihydrate was "taught in the prior art"). But Judge Rader held that inherent anticipation occurs when, more likely than not, an operation that is taught in the prior art would result in the claimed chemical. The anhydrate which was taught in the prior art would more than likely result in natural creation of some hemihydrate. Judge Gajarsa in concurrence argued that the drug was discovered not invented, making it unpatentable subject matter. Gajarsa’s opinion may have inspired the United States Supreme Court to raise the subject matter issue on its own (i.e., it had not been argued by the parties to the case) in Metabolite. The Supreme Court is considering whether to take the appeal on the self-replicating Paxil case as well.
It's becoming common to patent distributed systems.  For example, you might have a patent on server software S and client software C, where a person deploying server software S' and client software C' would infringe the patent.  But if S' is in Canada, and the C's are (at least in part) in the United States, does that also infringe the patent S+C?  And if so, where?  That's the big issue in NTP v. RIM, the "Blackberry case."  The latest news is that the district (trial-level) court will go ahead and move the case forward on remand while the case is appealed to the United States Supreme Court and the USPTO reexamines NTP's e-mail patents at the urging of RIM.  One of the issues the district court will look at is whether NTP reached a settlement with RIM for $450 million.  NTP wants more!
I've just read a very compelling theory of the origin of life.  This pegs my "that explains so many things!" meter in a very big way.  Alkaline vents -- the tame cousins of black smokers -- were common underneath earth's early oceans, but were chemically different than today.   They were a chemical engineer's utopia: high temperatures and pressures, iron-sulfur mineral catalysts, a substantial proton gradient (alkaline vent water to soda-water-like ocean) and vast amounts of surface area formed by microbubbles.  A new theory posits that Peter Mitchell's revolutionary discovery, proton-gradient manufacture of ATP, "the energy currency of life", was the original energy source of life, and that early evolution from primordial nucleic acids to the common ancestors of archaea, bacteria, and ourselves occurred in these sea-vent microbubbles.  A proton gradient across a membrane simply means that one side is more acidic (it contains more naked protons) and the other side is more alkaline (it contains more water molecules missing a proton, called "hydroxyl radicals" hydroxide ions).Because of Mitchell's discovery we now know that all known life uses membranes with proton gradients across them to convert energy into ATP molecules.  Wherever the energy comes from -- from light, from carbohydrates stolen from other organisms (i.e. eating food), wherever -- in every living thing it gets converted into a proton gradient that then is tapped to manufacture ATP.  In higher animals ATP is made from a proton gradient that is in turn made from "burning" blood sugar with oxygen, and this ATP powers our muscles and brains.  In plants ATP is central to photosynthesis: light striking chlorophyll generates a proton gradient, and that proton gradient is used to manufacture ATP, which in turn is used to make sugars and other plant carbohydrates.  In all life ATP powers the energy-using chemical reactions needed to make proteins, DNA, and RNA, the complex chemicals of life.   (For biochemists reading this, relax, this is a summary: I've necessarily left out a very large number of complex steps, many still not fully understood).The new theory of the origin of life recognizes that proton gradients existed on a massive scale in alkaline vents.  The primordial, carbon-dioxide-rich oceans were acidic like Coca-Cola: they contained too many protons.  These soda-water oceans were out of balance with the alkaline vent water, which contained water molecules with protons missing (hydroxide ions).   Protons streamed across this gradient, with the protons from the soda-water ocean filling up the proton-deficient hydroxide ions to create normal water molecules.  This stream of protons was a massive energy source that could be tapped to drive vast numbers of energy-consuming chemical reactions.  Large amounts and varieties of chemicals were made on the vast surface areas of the microbubbles, eventually leading to the immensely complex chemicals and reaction pathways (metabolisms) that became life.When, much later, plants evolved, they pulled almost all of the carbon dioxide out of the air and oceans, converting it into hydrocarbons and oxygen.   Then animals evolved that could breath the oxygen, "burning" it with carbohydrates from eating the plants.   Yet these very different energy sources get converted by plants and animals alike into the same thing -- proton gradients across membranes which are used to make ATP, the energy currency of life.Ironically, we humans by burning fossil fuels are putting a small fraction of this ancient carbon dioxide which plants removed from the air and oceans back into the air, where it not only may be causing a bit of global warming, but is also dissolving back into the oceans and turning them a bit more acidic -- a tiny step back in the direction of the primordial conditions in which carbon dioxide concentrations were vastly higher than our puny modern levels, making the origins of life possible.  The theory's ten-step recipe for life:1. Water percolated down into newly formed rock under the seafloor, where it reacted with minerals such as olivine, producing a warm alkaline fluid rich in hydrogen, sulphides and other chemicals - a process called serpentinisation.This hot fluid welled up at alkaline hydrothermal vents like those at the Lost City, a vent system discovered near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in 2000.2. Unlike today's seas, the early ocean was acidic and rich in dissolved iron. When upwelling hydrothermal fluids reacted with this primordial seawater, they produced carbonate rocks riddled with tiny pores and a "foam" of iron-sulphur bubbles.3. Inside the iron-sulphur bubbles, hydrogen reacted with carbon dioxide, forming simple organic molecules such as methane, formate and acetate. Some of these reactions were catalysed by the iron-sulphur minerals. Similar iron-sulphur catalysts are still found at the heart of many proteins today.4. The electrochemical gradient between the alkaline vent fluid and the acidic seawater leads to the spontaneous formation of acetyl phosphate and pyrophospate, which act just like adenosine triphosphate or ATP, the chemical that powers living cells.These molecules drove the formation of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – and nucleotides, the building blocks for RNA and DNA.5. Thermal currents and diffusion within the vent pores concentrated larger molecules like nucleotides, driving the formation of RNA and DNA – and providing an ideal setting for their evolution into the world of DNA and proteins. Evolution got under way, with sets of molecules capable of producing more of themselves starting to dominate.6. Fatty molecules coated the iron-sulphur froth and spontaneously formed cell-like bubbles. Some of these bubbles would have enclosed self-replicating sets of molecules – the first organic cells. The earliest protocells may have been elusive entities, though, often dissolving and reforming as they circulated within the vents.7. The evolution of an enzyme called pyrophosphatase, which catalyses the production of pyrophosphate, allowed the protocells to extract more energy from the gradient between the alkaline vent fluid and the acidic ocean. This ancient enzyme is still found in many bacteria and archaea, the first two branches on the tree of life.8. Some protocells started using ATP as well as acetyl phosphate and pyrophosphate. The production of ATP using energy from the electrochemical gradient is perfected with the evolution of the enzyme ATP synthase, found within all life today.9. Protocells further from the main vent axis, where the natural electrochemical gradient is weaker, started to generate their own gradient by pumping protons across their membranes, using the energy released when carbon dioxide reacts with hydrogen.This reaction yields only a small amount of energy, not enough to make ATP. By repeating the reaction and storing the energy in the form of an electrochemical gradient, however, protocells "saved up" enough energy for ATP production.10. Once protocells could generate their own electrochemical gradient, they were no longer tied to the vents. Cells left the vents on two separate occasions, with one exodus giving rise to bacteria and the other to archaea.More here. Dendritic carbonate growths on the Lost City alkaline ventGiven the vast complexity of the genes and metabolism that would likely have existed in the common rock-bubble ancestor of archaea and bacteria, I suspect it will be a long time before all but the simplest of these steps are recreated in a lab.  Still, this is by far the most compelling theory of the origin of life I've ever seen. Peter Mitchell, discoverer of the proton-gradient manufacture of ATP, was a fascinating character: instead of entering the "publish or perish" and "clique review" rat-race of government-funded science, he dropped out of mainstream scientific culture and set up his own charitable company (nonprofit in U.S. lingo), Glyn Research Ltd.   His discoveries were compelling enough to win over the early "he's a wingnut" skeptics and are now the centerpiece of our understanding of biological energetics.  My essay "The Trouble With Science" suggests why this kind of independence is good for science.  Here's more about Mitchell's theory of proton-powered life called chemiosmosis.   The ten-step process above is the theory of William Martin and Michael Russell, and is an extension of Gunter Wachterhauser's iron-sulfur world theory.
John Roland presents strong evidence that the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, ratified shortly after the end of the Civil War, was intentended to incorporate (as well as other parts of the Bill of Rights), as a restriction on States, the 2nd Amendment. It was incorporated in the form of an individual and equal right to keep and bear arms, even if, for the sake of argument, the original 2nd Amendment was not an individual right. There is also some evidence that the "liberty" part of the Due Process Clause was intended to protect, among other things, liberty of the house: that it included "... the right [of a person] to be safe and protected in that citadel of his love [i.e. his home] [and] ... to bear arms for the defense of himself and family and his homestead."
I often get asked to provide an overview of my political ideas.  There are so many elements to my ideas -- the importance of coercion and security and how to reconcile coercion with the substantive common law principle of non-initiation of force, the unique and crucial nature of procedural law, the role of low exit costs in enabling freedom and motivating the creation of good law, good vs. bad legal competition, the use (and intellectual recovery, where necessary) of highly-evolved or promising ideas such as political property rights, choice of law and forum, separation of duties with checks and balances, limits on delegation, "smart" (technologically codified and enforced) laws, and so on -- that it's impossible to write a summary article.

Alas, from what I've seen so far of the LabCorp v. Metabolite briefs, they don't hit on the biggest problem in this area, namely the problem of gratuitous elements.   I have written about how software became patentable in the United States.  In a nutshell, the forbidden category of algorithms became patentable because the trivial combination of (novel algorithhm + prior art patentable subject matter) was held by the Federal Circuit to be patentable subject matter.  Thus, a good patent drafter could simply added a broad prior art element such as "a device with memory" to an algorithm to make it patentable.  (All digital computers are devices with memory). Adding the gratuitous element did not add to the novelty or non-obviousness of the invention, but instead served to make the claim look like patentable subject matter.   In LabCorp v. Metabolite, the claim has the pattern (novel scientific discovery + prior art assay test).  LabCorp's brief argues that the claim covers a "law of nature" and is thus unpatentable.  But their main argument, following dicta in Diehr, that the claim covers all practical uses of the scientific discovery, is false.  Scientists and doctors are still free to discuss the scientific discovery and use it in ways that don't involve the assay test.  This severely cripples science and engineering involving the discovery without a license, but it doesn't 100% eliminate it as defendant Metabolite claims.  The problem is that this supposed holding of Diehr combined with the use of gratuitous elements makes the subject matter restrictions of 35 U.S.C. 101 an effective nullity.  Having failed to understand the problem of gratuitous elements, Metabolite is left without a good argument and the United States Patent system is left without any effective restrictions on what kinds of subject matter may be patented. The problem of gratuitous elements is not confined to subject matter patentability.  They also occur in damage calculations.  It is now common for patent drafters to add gratuitous elements to patent claims to make them cover larger markets.  An example, given by W. David Westergard, is that an inventor thinks of a new hinge for a door.  The patent drafter then drafts the claim (novel hinge + prior art door).   The jury is thus fooled into thinking that the patentee should be awarded damages for the lost profits on doors instead of just the lost profits on hinges.   Indeed, Jeffrey G. Sheldon in How To Write a Patent Application, the bible of patent drafting, recommends this strategy, giving the example of claiming a toaster when all that has been invented is the toaster thermostat.  "When negotiating a license or arguing damages before a jury, it would be better to work from a high royalty base that includes the entire toaster oven."  This problem of gratuitous elements used to inflate patent damage awards is particularly severe in modern electronic devices that can contain hundreds of patented parts or software.  It is one of the big motivations behind the damage reform provision in the 2005 Patent Act, which hopefully will be revived and enacted (with some recommended changes, which I will post in the future) in 2006.
Today was the start of that glorious lost cause that ultimately won, the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. That event is today's featured article on Wikipedia. Since Hungary finally won its freedom from communist rule and Soviet control in 1989, October 23rd has been a national holiday.Communism was an ideology based on envy of the rich but resulting in devastation to all. The keys to Soviet power were control over business, borders, and ideas. Control of the "commanding heights" of the economy and in particular control over food distribution made it highly dangerous to oppose communists rulers.The Soviet bloc severely restricted exit, a policy known as the "iron curtain." A communist state was a vast prison camp: the government fed you and you were not allowed to leave. Except for a brief period during the 1956 Revolution, this state of affairs lasted until Hungary opened its borders to free Austria in 1989, leading later that year to the fall of the Berlin Wall and freedom in Eastern Europe.Victim of communist genocide in the Ukraine, 1930s.The Soviets had a control over the observed reality and beliefs of its subjects that is hard to imagine in today's Internet era. The communist party owned all broadcast stations and newspapers and severely restricted smaller-scale means of communications such as telephones, small printing presses, and copy machines (and later faxes and computers). Government art encouraged secular worship of a godlike Marxist avant-garde, echoing the deification of emperors in imperial Rome.A crucial event in fighting totalitarianism: rebels took control of a radio station from the communist media monopoly and redubbed it "Magyar Szabad Radio" (Hungarian Free Radio)Thus, although the Soviets had already murdered millions, directly and through robbery of food and other vital supplies (as in "Ukranian famines" under both Lenin and Stalin), little was known about these events: behind the iron curtain all mention of them was excised from academia and media; outside the iron curtain they were unknown, denied, or ignored. To this day these events, collectively the greatest mass murders in world history committed by any ideological movement within a single century, remain largely forgotten thanks to the remarkably successful efforts of Soviets in destroying or simply failing to report publicly the evidence.Meatspace blog: messages for rebels in shop window.The resignation of the Stalin-era dictator Mátyás Rákosi under pressure from the new Soviet dictator Kruschev in July of 1956 emboldened Hungarians to speak somewhat more freely among themselves. László Rajk, judicially murdered under the Rákosi regime, was reburied and celebrated and the anti-Stalinist Imre Nagy (pronounced "Nahj") was invited to rejoin the Hungarian Worker's Party (the communist party and the only legal party). On October 16th students in University of Szeged boycotted the official party student union and reestablished the non-communist MEFESZ student union which had been banned under Rákosi. Soon students all over Hungary followed suit.Students demonstrating.Members of the Hungarian Writer's Union and students, numbering over ten thousand, gathered to demand reform on October 23rd -- 50 years ago today -- at the statute of General Bem, a hero of Hungary's War of Independence in 1849. Students who had brought some Hungarian flags started cutting out the hated communist red star from the flags, leaving ragged circles. By 6 p.m., the crowd had crossed the Danube to the Parliament Building. Enthusiastic locals swelled it to probably well over a hundred thousand. Some enthusiasts toppled the largest Stalin statue, leaving his boots.Stalin's boots. The government radio stations, the only ones allowed, railed that the crowds were "reactionary mobs." ("Reactionary" was the favorite insult of self-styled "progressives" in both the Soviet bloc and the West.) In response a crowd gathered at Radio Budapest, guared by the State Protection Authority (Államvédelmi Hatóság or ÁVH), the communist Hungarian equivalent of the U.S. FBI. When some of the crowd's leaders expressed demands for equal time on the radio to rebut the government's slanders, the ÁVH detained them and the crowd grew even angrier. Soon the ÁVH fired tear gas into the crowd, and soon after that started shooting into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers (of the regular army) were sent in to assist the ÁVH, but when some soldiers witnessed the protestors being fired on they mutinied, joining the crowd. The crowd and its new army recruits fanned out, siezing control of military depots and distributing guns. The Revolution had begun.Rebels overan the communist party's headquarters and cut out the hated red star from the Hungarian flag.Ghandian non-violent resistance only works where there is a well-established free press sympathetic to the resisters. This was certainly not the case behind the iron curtain in 1956. After the ÁVH fired on unarmed protestors most of the Hungarian Army sided with the protestors, defended them from the ÁVH, and helped them capture the government radio station. With control of the radio station rebels were able to broadcast their rebuttals of the government's slanders, to call for justice against the murderers of protestors, and to make their case for anti-communist reforms. Military depots were raided and arms distributed to civilian rebels, defeating communist gun control. 
Besides the extraordinary rises in commodity prices and near-tripling of the U.S. federal government's default risk, another important factor for those interested the world's economy to keep in mind is that foreign governments have been bailing out the U.S. federal government by buying more of its Treasury bonds. Much of the increase in inflation expectations, and now in overt default expectations, reflected in commodity prices probably comes from the possibility that this ongoing foreign bailout of the U.S. may at some point stop and reverse.  If foreign central banks and sovereign funds suddendly dumped their Treasuries -- which paying a negative real interest rate and exposing one to dollar risk are after all a rather bad investment -- either the Federal Reserve would have to madly "print" trillions of dollars to buy up these Treasuries, causing oil prices to skyrocket still further and retail gasoline prices to quite possibly jump each week by dollars per gallon, until American cars, trucks, and airplanes would be useless, or the federal government, facing extraordinary costs of funding its deficits, would have to overtly default.   The problem the Federal Reserve faces is that with modern digital markets any inflationary behavior on its part is reflected in oil prices as soon as any big money learns about said behavior, and is thus usually reflected at the retail gas pump within a week.  I wrote in the above-linked post about sovereign debt risk of "covert default" through inflation, but that is an obsolete phrase -- you can go down to the local gas station and see these de facto federal defaults in progress.  If foreign governments thought the Federal Reserve was going to hyperinflate, that would probably cause them to dump the Treasuries in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.   It would be a run on the federal government itself, the biggest run on a bank the world has ever seen.  This is not a probable risk, but it has now become a quite signficant risk.  The ongoing foreign bailout of the U.S. government by massive purchases of Treasury debt helps explain two things: (1) why U.S. Treasuries and bank rates related to them don't seem to be reflecting inflation expectations (i.e. why they are paying negative real interest rates compared to the expected inflation suggested by commodity prices) -- their price is being held artificially low, not just by Federal Reserve net purchases but by foreign central bank net and sovereign fund purchases as well.  Add to this the natural reduction in their interest rate due to the credit crunch causing a flight for safety (in a credit cruch people are willing to pay even negative real interest rates for a relatively safe investment).  The foreign bailout also explains (2) why commodity prices have raced so far ahead of PPI and CPI inflation.  Commodity prices may reflect, not so much increases in the dollar supply beyond dollar demand that have already happened, nor even expectations of a steady future consumer inflation that will happen eventually, nor an iminent severe consumer inflation is sure to happen soon, but expectations of a severe consumer inflation that mostly hasn't happened yet and may not happen, and of a possible Zimbabwe/Weimar-style hyperinflation that probably won't happen.  But the increase in the probability of severe inflation combined with a great increase in the formerly extremely small (and still small, but not extremely so) probabilities of the more extreme hyperinflation still averages out to rather high inflation expectations.  Why are central bankers bailing out the U.S. federal government and its dollar rather than acting like rational profit maximizers?   Central bankers and government treasury officials are very political animals, and they fear the disaster they believe would ensue should the "full faith and credit of the United States [federal government]" fail.  It is the most unthinkable economic event for the entity with the most collosal budget, and the dominant threatener and wielder of military force in the world, to go under.   The U.S. federal government has now deemed Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac "too big to fail" and has bailed them out.   That federal government itself is the ultimate entity that is "too big to fail", and thus foreign governments and central bankers are bailing it out, and will probably (but hardly surely) continue to do.Extrapolating from oil prices rises (i.e. assuming the entire oil price rise has been due to monetary factors rather than to consumption, production cost, or non-monetary political fundamentals) using the net present value formula over 50 years, I estimate that long-run dollar inflation expectations have risen about 5%/year from 1998, when there the Asian crisis caused a flight to the dollar and many people thought deflation was the bigger worry, to today.   This might for example reflect an increase in expectations from 0% to 5%/year, or 1% to 6%/year, etc. -- I don't have a way to estimate the absolute value.  Gold price rises over the last decade give a slightly smaller rise in inflation expectations, of about 4%/year.  Note that this doesn't mean 5% or 6%/year CPI or PPI inflation over the next 50 years is inevitable -- increased expectations reflect a range of probabilities, especially very heightened increases in probability estimates of extreme (>10%/year) and hyper (>100%/year) inflation in the dollar.   It's also still significantly possible that the ultimate lagging indicator, "core inflation", will stay in the 2-3%/year range and the whole storm will blow over.  Besides the great rise in commodity prices, in particular the most "money-like" commodities oil and precious metals, the foreign bailout of the U.S. federal government is another reason to believe that all major currencies are falling against a hypothetical stable standard of value, not just the dollar.  As foreign central banks buy more U.S. Treasuries they take on more of the risk associated with the dollar, so we should expect the floating currencies these central banks issue to move more in correlation with each other.  Indeed, the dollar has held its own against the euro and against on average other major currencies since February as foreign central bank purchases of Treasuries have accelerated.People interested in my writings about money might also want to check out my classic essay on monetary origins, "Shelling Out: The Origins of Money", my classic essay on micropayments, and my overview of the monetary reasons for the broad-based commodity price increases over the last decade and in particular over the last five years.
